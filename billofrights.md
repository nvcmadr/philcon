Bill of Rights – It is a set of prescriptions setting forth the fundamental
civil  and  political  rights  of  the  individual,  and  imposing  limitations  on  the
powers of the government as a means of securing the enjoyment of those
rights. (PBM Employees Org vs PBM, 51 SCRA 189)

## Kinds
Classification of Rights:

- Political rights – granted by law to members of community in relation to
their direct or indirect participation in the establishment or administration of
the government;

- Civil  rights – rights  which  municipal  law  will  enforce  at  the  instance  of
private  individuals  for the  purpose  of  securing them  the  enjoyment of their
means of happiness. p 91 Nachura

The Bill of Rights governs the relationship between the individual and
the  State.  Its  concern  is  not  the  relation  of  individuals,  between  a  private
individual  and  other  individuals.  What  the  Bill  of  Rights  does  is  to  declare
some forbidden zones in the private sphere inaccessible to any power holder
(People vs Marti GR 81561)

It is generally self- executing. (p. 91 Nachura)



Due Process simply states that it is part of the sporting idea of fair play
to hear the other side before an opinion is formed or a decision is made by
those who sit in judgment. (Ynot vs. IAC, 148 SCRA 659)

A law which hears before it condemns, which proceeds upon inquiry
and renders judgment only after trial (Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4
## Wheaton 518).

a) Relativity of DP - In the book of Bernas at page 32, it was asked:
“Is the requirement of substantive DP a rigid concept?”
Bernas answered that: the heart of substantive DP is the requirement
of  reasonableness  or  absence  of  exercise  of  arbitrary  power.  These  are
NECESSARILY     RELATIVE     CONCEPTS     which     depend     on     the
circumstances of every case.
## DUE PROCESS



The phrase due process itself is a term that defies exact definition or
meaning,  the  same  being  left  to  be  developed  and  applied  as  cases  and
situations  come  along. Appltying  the  Due  Process  Clause  necessarily
involves valud judgments,as there constantly comes into play the imperative
to  make  adjustments  and  accommodations  to  the  various  needs  and
demands  of  society.  Once  it  is  determined  that  DP  applies,  the  question
remains  what  process  is  due.  DP  is  flexible,  and  calls  for  such  procedural
protections  as  the  particular  situation  demands.  Consideration  of  what
procedures DP may require under any given set of circumstances must begin
with  a  determination  of  the  precise  nature  of  the  government  function
involved, as  well  as  of  the  private  interest  that  has  been  affected  by  a
governmental action. In the case of Sec of Justice vs Lantion 343 SCRA
377,  Justice  Puno  said  that  procedural  DP  required  by  a  given  set  of
circumstances must begin with the determination of the precise nature of the
government function involved as well as the private interests that has been
affected by the governmental action. The concept of DP is flexible for not all
situations  calling  for  procedural  safeguards  call  for  the  same  kind  of
procedure. (Gorospe p. 80 – 82)
b) Procedural and Substantive DP

Substantive due process – Asks whether the government has an adequate
reason for taking away a person’s life, liberty or property. In other words,
substantive  DP  looks  to  whether  there  is  a  sufficient  justification  for  the
government’s action. Whether there is  such  a  justification depends  very
much on the level of the scrutiny used.

-If  a  law  is  in  an  area  where  only  the  rational  basis  test  is  applied –
substantive DP is met so long as the law is rationally related to a legitimate
governmental purpose.

-If such is an area where strict scrutiny is used, then the government
will  meet  substantive  DP  only  if  it  can  prove  that  the  law  is  necessary  to
achieve  compelling  government  purpose. (City  of  Manila  vs  Laguio  GR
118127; p. 75 Duka)

Substantive DP serves as a restriction on the government’s law and
rule-making powers. The following are the requisites:
- the interests of the public in general, as distinguished from those of
a particular class, require the intervention of the State; (Lawful Subject)


- the    means    employed    are    reasonably    necessary    for    the
accomplishment  of  the  purpose  and  not  unduly  oppressive  on  individuals.
(Lawful Means) (p. 93 Nachura).

Publication of laws is part of substantive DP. Without such notice and
publication,  there  would  be  no basis  for  the  application  of  the  maxim
ignorantia legis non excusat.  It would be the height of injustice to punish or
otherwise burden a citizen for the transgression of a law of w/c he had no
notice whatsoever, not even a constructive one.  It is needless to say that
the publication of presidential issuances "of a public nature" or "of general
applicability" is a requirement of due process.  It is a rule of law that before
a  person  may  be  bound  by  law,  he  must  first  be  officially  and  specifically
informed of its contents.  (Tañada vs Tuvera 136 SCRA 27)

Take Note: Presumption when the State acts to interfere with life, liberty,
or property – Valid

Procedural DP – refers to the procedures that the government must follow
before it deprives a person of life, liberty, or property.

Essence of procedural DP – embodied in the basic requirement of notice
and real opportunity to be heard. (Casimiro vs Tandog GR 146137)

Procedural due process – this serves as a restriction on actions of judicial
and quasi-judicial agencies of the government.

Requisites of Civil DP:
- an  impartial  court  or  tribunal  clothed  with  judicial  power  to  hear  and
determine the matters before it;

- jurisdiction  properly  acquired  over  the  person  of  the  defendant  and
over property which is the subject matter of the proceeding;

- opportunity to be heard;

- judgment  rendered  upon  lawful  hearing  and  based  on  evidence
adduced (Banco  Español  Filipino  v.  Palanca,  G.R.  No.  L-11390,
## March 26, 1918).


Requisites of Criminal DP

- Accused is heard by a court of competent jurisdiction;

- Accused is proceeded against under the orderly process of law;

- Accused is given notice and opportunity to be heard;

- Judgment  rendered  is  within  the  authority  of  the  constitutional  law
(People vs Vera)

Requisites of Administrative DP
- Right  to  hearing – includes right to present one’s case and submit
evidence to support thereof;

- Tribunal or body or any of its judges must act on its own independent
consideration of the law and facts of the controversy;

- Tribunal must consider the evidence presented;

- Evidence  must  be  substantial,  which  means  relevant  evidence  as  a
reasonable might accept as adequate to support a conclusion;

- Decision must have something to support itself;

- Decision must  be  based  on  evidence presented  during  hearing or  at
least contained in the record and disclosed by the parties;

- Decision must be rendered in a manner that the parties can know the
various issues involved and the reason for the decision rendered (Ang
Tibay vs CIR)

Requisites for DP for students before imposition of disciplinary actions

- must be informed in writing of the nature and cause of the accusation
against him;

- right to answer charges against him, with the assistance of counsel, if
desired.;


- Informed of the evidence against him;

- Right to adduce evidence in his behalf;

- Evidence must be duly considered by the investigating committee or
official designated by the school to hear and decide the case. (ADMU
vs Capulong 222 SCRA 644)


Take Note: Appeal is not a natural right nor a part of DP. But where the
Constitution  gives  a  person  the  right  to  appeal,  e.g. cases  under  the
minimum appellate jurisdiction of the SC, denial of right to appeal constitutes
violation of DP. Also, if there is a statutory grant provided that the same is
made  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  law. (Sapad  vs  CA  GR
## 132153)

Take Note: Preliminary investigation is not a constitutional right but merely
statutory. But where there is a statutory grant for PI, denial of the same is an
infringement of DP.

Constitutional and Statutory DP – See Serrano vs NLRC and Agabon
vs NLRC 323 SCRA 445  (442 SCRA 573)

Constitutional  DP – protects  the  individual  from  the  government  and
assures him of his rights in criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings.

Statutory DP – found in the Labor Code and Implementing Rules protects
employees from being unjustly terminated without just cause after notice and
hearing.

In these cases, the 30-day notice requirement in case of termination
for an authorized cause is held to be not a part of DP. First, the DP clause in
the Constitution is a limitation on governmental powers. It does not apply to
the  exercise  of  a  private  power,  such  as  the  termination  of  employment.
Second, the purpose for requiring such notice is only to give the employee
time to prepare for the eventual loss of his job. Third, the employer cannot
really be expected to be entirely an impartial judge. It was also held in these
cases that not all notice requirements are requirements of DP. It was held
that  not  all  notice  requirements  are  requirements  of  DP.  Some  are  simply
part  of  procedure  to  be  followed  before  a  right  granted  to  a  party  can  be

exercised.  Others  are  simply  an  application  of  the  Justinian  precept,
embodied in the Civil Code, to act with justice, give everyone xxx. Such is
the notice requirement in Arts 282-283. The consequence of the failure either
of  the  employer  or  the  employee  to  live  up  to  this  precept  is  to  make  him
liable in damages, not to render his act void.


Hierarchy of Rights

In SJS  vs Atienza,  545  SCRA  92,  it  was  held  that  the  right  to  life
enjoys precedence over the right to property.

Freedom  of  expression  has  gained  recognition  as  a  fundamental
principle  of  every  democratic  government,  and  given  a  preferred  right  that
stands  on  a  higher  level  than  substantive  economic  freedom  or  other
liberties. (Chavez vs Gonzales 545 SCRA 441)

In Philippine Blooming Mills Employees Organization vs PBM Co
GR L-31195, Justice Makasiar stressed that:

In a democracy, the preservation and enhancement of the dignity and
worth  of  the  human  personality  is  the  central  core  as  well  as  the  cardinal
article of faith of our civilization.

The happiness  of the  individual,  not  the  well-being  of the  State, was
the criterion by which its behaviour was to be judged. His interests, not its
power, set the limits to the authority it was entitled to exercise.

The rights of free expression, free assembly and petition, are not only
civil rights but also political rights essential to man’s enjoyment of his life, to
his happiness and to his full and complete fulfillment.

While  the  Bill  of  Rights  also  protects  property  rights,  the  primacy  of
human rights over property rights is recognized. Property and property rights
can be lost thru prescription; but human rights are imprescriptible.

In  the  hierarchy  of  civil  liberties, the  rights  of  free  expression  and  of
assembly   occupy   a   preferred   position   as   they   are   essential   to   the
preservation and vitality of our civil and political institutions; and such priority
“gives these liberties the sanctity and the sanction not permitting dubious

intrusions”.  The  superiority  of  these  freedoms  over  property  rights  is
underscored by the fact that a mere reasonable or rational relation between
the means employed by the law and its object or purpose – that the law is
neither arbitrary nor discriminatory nor oppressive – would suffice to validate
a  law  which  restricts  or  impairs  property  rights.  On  the  other  hand,  a
constitutional or valid infringement of human rights requires a more stringent
criterion, namely existence of a grave and immediate danger of a substantive
evil which the State has the right to prevent. (p. 17-19 Duka).

In the case of People vs Tudtud 412 SCRA 142, it was held –

The right against unreasonable search and seizure in turn is at the top
of the hierarchy of rights, next only to, if not on the same plane as, the right
to life, liberty and property, which is protected by the due process clause.

Whenever rights founded on life or liberty clash with rights founded on
property considerations, the proper allocation of weights would have to be
undertaken. (Blo Umpar Adiong vs COMELEC 207 SCRA 712)

Judicial Standards of Review

These are the following:

Mere rationality deferential review standard – Laws are upheld if they
rationally further a legitimate governmental interest, without courts seriously
inquiring into the substantiality of such interest and examining the alternative
means   by   which   the   objectives   could   be   achieved (Estrada   vs
Sandiganbayan 369 SCRA 394).

It  has  been  described  as  adopting  a  deferential  attitude  towards
legislative  classifications.  The  Rational  Basis  Test  remains  the  primary
standard  for  evaluating  the  constitutionality  of  a  statute. (Central  Bank
Employees Assn vs BSP 446 SCRA 299).
Middle-level  review  or  intermediate  review  or  heightened  scrutiny
standard – Under   the   intermediate   review,   the   substantiality   of   the
governmental  interest  is  seriously  looked  into  and  the  availability  of  less
restrictive   alternatives   are   considered.   Such   classifications   must   be
substantially related to a sufficiently important governmental interest. The US
SC has generally applied Intermediate Review when the challenged statute’s
classification  is  based  on  either  gender,  illegitimacy  and  under  certain

circumstance,  legal  residency  with  regard  to  availment  of  free  public
education,  civil  service  employment  preference  for  armed  forces  veterans
who  are  state  residents  upon  entry  to  military  service,  and  the  right  to
practice  for  compensation  the  profession  for  which certain  persons  have
been qualified and licensed. (Estrada vs Sandiganbayan)

## Strict Scrutiny Standard

Under strict scrutiny, the focus is on the presence of compelling, rather
than substantial governmental interest and on the absence of less restrictive
means for achieving that interest.

Strict  scrutiny  is  applied  when  the  challenged  statute  either  (1)
classifies  on  the  basis  of  inherently  suspect  characteristic  or  (2)  infringes
fundamental  constitutional  rights.  With  respect  to  such  classifications, the
usual presumption of constitutionality is reversed, and it is incumbent upon
the  government  to  demonstrate  that  its  classification  has  been  narrowly
tailored to further compelling governmental interests, otherwise the law shall
be  declared  unconstitutional  for  being  violative  of  the  Equal  Protection
## Clause.

In San Antonio Independent School Dist vs Rodriguez 411 US 1,
the US  SC  articulated  that  suspect  classifications  were  not  limited  to
classifications based on race, alienage, or national origin but could also be
applied to other criteria such as religion.

Void-for-vagueness doctrine

Void-for-vagueness rule – accused is denied the right to be informed
of the charge against him, and to due process as well, where the statute itself
is  couched  in such  indefinite  language  that  it  is  not  possible  for  men  of
ordinary  intelligence  to  determine  therefrom  what  acts  or  omissions  are
punished and, hence shall be avoided.

It  is  repugnant  to  the  Constitution  in  two  respects:it  violates  DP  for
failure to accord persons, especially the parties targeted by it, fair notice of
the conduct to avoid.


It  leaves  law  enforcers  unbridled    discretion  in  carrying  out  its
provisions  and  become  an  arbitrary  flexing  of  the  Government  muscle.
(People v. Nazario, G.R. No. 44143)

An  act  will  be  declared  void  and  inoperative  on  the  ground  of
vagueness and uncertainty only upon a showing that the defect is such that
the courts are unable to determine, with any reasonable degree of certainty,
what the legislature intended. (p. 76 Duka).

Vagueness doctrine merely requires a reasonable degree of certainty
for  the  statute  to  be  upheld – not  absolute  precision  or  mathematical
exactitude.  Flexibility,  rather  than  meticulous  specificity  is  permissible  as
long as the metes and bounds of the statute are clearly delineated. (Estrada
vs Sandiganbayan 369 SCRA 394)




a) Concept - The equal protection of the law clause is against undue
favor and individual or class privilege, as well as hostile discrimination or the
oppression of inequality. It is not intended to prohibit legislation, which it is
limited either in the object to which it is directed or by territory within which is
to operate. It does not demand absolute equality among residents; it merely
requires that all persons shall be treated alike, under like circumstances and
conditions both as to privileges conferred and liabilities enforced. The equal
protection clause is not infringed by legislation which applies only to those
persons falling within a specified class, if it applies alike to all persons within
such class, and reasonable grounds exists for making a distinction between
those  who  fall  within  such  class  and  those  who  do  not. (Ichong  vs
## Hernandez)

But substantive equality is not enough. It is also required that the law
be enforced and applied equally. As held by the US Supreme Court, even if
the law be fair and impartial on its face, it will still violate equal protection if it
is administered “with an evil eye and an uneven hand”, so as to unjustly
benefit some and prejudice others. (p. 124 Cruz)

The  clause  also  commands  the  State  to  pass  laws  which  positively
promote equality or reduce existing inequalities. (p. 37 Bernas)

## 4. EQUAL PROTECTION


b) Requisites of Valid Classification:

- Such classification rests upon substantial distinctions;
- It is not confined to existing conditions only;
-  It applies equally to all members of the same class;
-   It is germane to the purposes of the law. (People v. Cayat),
- reasonable relation to the purpose of the law.



a) Concept - The right against unreasonable searches and seizures is
the immunity of one's person, which includes his residence, his papers, and
other possessions. The guarantee refers to "the right of personal security" of
the individual.  What is sought to be protected against the State's unlawful
intrusion are persons, not places. To conclude otherwise would lead to the
absurd logic that for a person to be immune against unreasonable searches
and  seizures,  he  must  be  in  his  home  or  office,  within  a  fenced  yard  or  a
private place. The Bill of Rights belongs as much to the person in the street
as to the individual in the sanctuary of his bedroom. (People v. Valdez, 25
## September 2000)

- Available to all persons, including aliens whether accused of crime or
not.

- Artificial persons are entitled to the guaranty but they may be required
to open their books of accounts for examination by the State in the exercise
of the police power or the power of taxation. Their premises may be not be
searched nor may their papers and effects be seized except by virtue of a
valid warrant. (Qua Chee Gan vs Deportation Board)

- The right is personal; it may be invoked only by the person entitled
to it Such right                                     may be waived either expressly or
impliedly. (Stonehill v. Diokno)


Who can invoke – All persons, including aliens, whether accused of a crime
or not. Artificial persons are also entitled to the guarantee, though may be
required to open their books of accounts for examination by the State in the
exercise of PP and taxing powers. (Moncada vs People’s Court 80 Phil 1.)

## 5.  SEARCHES ANS SEIZURES


The right is personal. Hence, waiver, express or implied, must be made
by the person entitled to it. (Stonehill vs Diokno 20 SCRA 383).

To whom does the right apply

The right applies as a restraint directed only against the government
and its agencies tasked with the enforcement of the law. (People vs Marti
GR 81561). The Bill of Rights does not protect citizens from unreasonable
searches  and  seizure  by  private  individuals. (Waterous  Drug  Corp  vs
NLRC.) However, it may be possible to find a remedy in the Civil Code. (p.
## 38 Bernas)

What   the   constitutional   prohibition   prohibits   are   unreasonable
searches and seizures. Searches and seizures are normally unreasonable
unless authorized by a validly issued search warrant or warrant of arrest. A
reasonable search is not to be determined by any fixed formula but is to be
resolved  according  to  the  facts  of  the  case.  There  is  no  presumption  of
regularity in search cases. (p. 38 Bernas.)

Purpose of Sec 2 Article III

To protect the privacy and sanctity of the person and of his house and
other possessions against arbitrary intrusions by State officers. p. 37 Bernas.

What could be referred to by the phrase searches and seizures of
whatever nature and for whatever purpose?
It extends to 2 penumbral areas.
First, subpoena duces tecum.
Second, building inspection by administrative officers. (Bernas p. 45)

Take  Note: Illegality  of  the  arrest – is  not  jurisdictional; objection
thereto  is  waived  where  the  person  submits  to  arraignment  without  any
objection. (People vs Del Rosario GR 127755)

Where to file

## A. Search Warrant:

1) Where a case is pending – Court wherein the same is filed or the
assigned branch thereof has primary jurisdiction to issue the search warrant.


2)  No  criminal  case  pending  yet – The  executive  judges,  or  their
lawful substitutes, in the areas and for the offense contemplated in Circular
1-91, shall have primary jurisdiction. (Malalaon vs CA 232 SCRA 249)
>  This  does  not  mean  however,  that  a  Court,  whose  territorial
jurisdiction does not embrace the place to be searched cannot issue a search
warrant therefore, where the obtention of such warrant is necessitated and
justified by compelling considerations of urgency, subject, time, and place.
(Ilano vs CA 244 SCRA 346)

Determination  thereof  rests  with  the  court  where  application  is  filed
subject to review with the appellate court in case of grave abuse of discretion.
(People vs Chui GR 142915-16)



Where a search warrant is issued by one court and the criminal action
based on the results of the search is commenced in another court, motion to
quash  the  warrant  or  to  retrieve  things  thereunder  seized  may  be  filed  in
either issuing court or that in which the criminal action was filed. (People vs
## CA GR 126379)


Such  remedy  however  is  alternative,  not  cumulative.  The  court  first
taking  cognizance of  the motion  does so  to the  exclusion  of  the other and
the  proceedings  thereon  are  subject  to  the  Omnibus  Motion  Rule  and  the
rule against forum-shopping. (Garaygay vs People GR 135503)

The judge may order the quashal of the warrant he issued even after
the same had already been implemented, particularly when such quashal is
based  on  the  finding  that  there  was  no  offense  committed.  The  effect  oof
such  quashal  is  that  the items  seized  shall  be  inadmissible  in  evidence.
(People vs Francisco GR 129035)

B. Warrant of Arrest:
Court where the information is filed. (People vs Chui GR 142915-16)

Permutations of the right to the security of persons:
a. The right to security of person is freedom from fear.

b. The  right  to  a  security  of  a  person  is  a  guarantee  of  bodily  and
psychological integrity or security.
c. The right to security of a person is a guarantee of protection of one’s
rights by the government. (p. 86-88 Duka)

## Exclusionary Rule
>Consequence  of  a  search  or  seizure  without  a  warrant – Any
evidence obtained in such shall be inadmissible in ANY proceeding. [Art II
## Sec 3(2).]
>Effect of application for bail wrt to validity of a warrant – (Section
26, Rule 114 ROC)



b) Warrant Requirement

As mentioned earlier, warrant is necessary for the arrest or the seizure
to be “reasonable”. Read Sec 6 Rule 112 of the ROC

Requisites of a valid warrant
- it must be issued upon probable cause
- probable cause must be determined personally by a judge
- such  judge  must  examine  under  oath  or  affirmation  the  complainant
and the witnesses he may produce
- the  warrant  must  particularly  describe  the  place  to  be  searched  and
the person or things to be seized. (p. 39 Bernas)

## Probable Cause

Probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest – Such facts
and circumstances which would lead a reasonable discreet and prudent man
to believe that an offense has been committed by the person sought to be
arrested. (Henry vs US, 1959 case, p. 40 Bernas)

Probable  cause  for  search– Such  facts  and  circumstances  which
would lead a reasonable discreet and prudent man to believe that an offense
has  been  committed  and  that  the  objects  sought  in  connection  with  the
offense  are  in  the place to  be  searched. (Henry  vs US,  1959  case, p.  40
## Bernas)


Warrant must refer to one specific offense

However,  in  the  case  of People  vs  Dichoso  223  SCRA  174,  it  was
held that one search warrant may be validly issued for several violations of
the Dangerous Drugs Act.

Evidence  needed to  establish  PC – those of a  reasonably  prudent man,
not  the  exacting  calibrations  of  a  full  blown  trial.  PC  is  concerned  with
probability,  not  absolute  or  even  moral  certainty. (Microsoft  vs  Maxicorp
## GR 140946)

Should proof of PC refer to a specific offender?
a. Search warrant – No
b. Warrant of arrest – Yes (Webb vs de Leon GR 121234)

## Personal Determination

Meaning of “personally” in the search and seizure clause
As  to  warrant  of arrest - personal  determination  and  not  personal
examination of a judge. (Soliven vs Makasiar).

The  judge  shall  personally  evaluate  the  report  and  the  supporting
documents submitted by the fiscal regarding the existence of PC and, on the
basis thereof, issue a warrant of arrest; or if, on the basis thereof, he finds
no PC, he may disregard the prosecutor’s report and require the submission
of supporting affidavits of witnesses to aid him in arriving at a conclusion as
to the existence of PC. (Cruz vs Judge Areola AM No. RTJ-01-1642.)

The judge must look at the report, the affidavits, the transcripts of steno
notes (if any), and all other supporting documents behind the Prosecutor’s
certification. (Lim vs Felix GR 94054-57).

The same rule applies to election offenses even if, in such cases, the
PI is done by the COMELEC. (People vs Delgado. 189 SCRA 715.)

Hearing is not necessary. In Webb vs De Leon 247 SCRA 652, it was
held that the judge would simply personally review the initial determination
of the prosecutor to see if it is supported by substantial evidence.


The  judge  is  not  tasked  to  review  in  detail  the  evidence  submitted
during PI. It is sufficient that the judge should personally evaluate the report
and  supporting  documents  submitted  by  the  prosecution  in  determining
probable cause. (Cruz vs People 233 SCRA 439)

As to search warrant - the examining magistrate must make probing
and exhaustive, not merely routine or pro forma examination of the applicant
and the witnesses. (p. 92 Duka)
Determination of PC for filing an information

Such  lies  with  the  prosecution  which  is  an  executive  function.  Its
correctness  is  a  matter  that  the  trial  court  itself  does  not  and  may  not  be
compelled to pass upon. (People vs CA GR 126005)

Examination under oath or affirmation

General Rule: Where  the  judge  failed  to  conform  with  the  essential
requisites of taking the deposition in writing and attaching them to the record,
it  was  held  that  search  warrant  is  invalid,  and  the  fact  that  the  objection
thereto  was  raised  only  during  the  trial  is  of  no  moment,  because  the
absence of such depositions was discovered only after the arrest and during
the trial. (People vs Mamaril GR 147607)

Exception: Such omission is not fatal if there is evidence on record showing
that  such  personal  examination  was  conducted  and  what  testimony  was
presented. (People vs Tee GR 140546-47)

## Particularity

The rule is that a description of the place to be searched is sufficient if
the officer with the warrant can, with reasonable effort, ascertain and identify
the  place  intended  to  be  searched.   (People  v.  Salanguit,  G.R.  Nos.
## 133254-55.)

In  determining  the  sufficiency  of  the  description  of  the  address,  the
executing officer’s prior knowledge of the place intended in the warrant is
relevant eg. the executing officer was also the affiant on whose affidavit the
warrant had issued. (Burgos Sr.  vs Chief of Staff. 133 SCRA 800.)


A search warrant may be said to particularly describe the things to be
seized when the description therein is as specific as the circumstances will
ordinarily  allow  and  by which the warrant officer may  be guided  in making
the search and seizure.

However,  it  is  not  required  that  a  technical  description  be  given.
(People v. Rubio)

Purpose  of  particularity – To  prevent  abuse  by  the  officer  enforcing  the
warrant by leaving to him no discretion as to who or what to search or seize.

Take Note: Gen Rule : John Doe warrants are void.
Exception: If such warrants contain a description personae to enable
the officer to identify the accused.

General  Rule: Only  the  judge  has  the  power  to  issue  a  warrant  after  the
proper procedure has been duly taken.
## Exceptions:
- The  Commissioner  of  Immigration  and  Deportation  may  issue  warrants
only  for  the  purpose  of  carrying  out  a  final  decision  of  deportation (CID  v.
Judge De la Rosa, G.R. No. 95122-23, May 31, 1991) or if there is sufficient
proof of guilt of an alien (Harvey v. Defensor- Santiago, G.R. No. 82544,
June 28, 1988; Qua Chee Gan v. Deportation Board. )

In such case, probable cause is not necessary.

Warrant of arrest may be issued by administrative authorities only for
the purpose of carrying out a final finding of a violation of law and not for the
sole  purpose  of  investigation  or  prosecution. – It may  be  issued  only  after
the proceeding has taken place as when there is already a final decision of
the administrative authorities.(Morano vs Vivo 20 SCRA 562)

c. Warrantless Searches

In  these  cases  (except  Terry  search),  probable  cause  is  necessary.
PC, in these cases, must only be based on reasonable grounds of suspicion
or  belief  that  a  crime  has  been  committed  or  is  about  to  be  committed  as
determined by the searching officer. (People vs Aruta GR 120915)


a. Search incident to a lawful arrest.  A person lawfully arrested may
be searched for dangerous weapons or anything which may have been used
or constitute proof in the commission of an offense without a search warrant.
(Sec. 13, Rule 126, ROC)

A person lawfully arrested may be searched for dangerous weapons
or anything which may be used as proof of the commission of the offense.
The search may extend beyond the person of the one arrested to include the
permissible area or surroundings within his immediate control.

The  lawful  arrest  being  the  sole  justification  for  the  validity  of  the
warrantless  search  under  the  exception,  the  same  must  be  limited  to  and
circumscribed by the subject, time and place of the arrest.

As to subject, the warrantless search is sanctioned only with respect
to  the  person  of  the  suspect,  and  things  that  may  be  seized  from  him  are
limited to “dangerous weapons” or “anything which may be used as proof off
the commission of the offense.”

With  respect to time  and  place  of the warrantless  search,  it must be
contemporaneous with  the  lawful  arrest.   Stated  otherwise, to  be  valid the
search  must  be  conducted  at  about  the  time  of  the  arrest  or  immediately
thereafter  and  only  at  the  place  where  the  suspect  was  arrested,  or  the
premises  or  surroundings  under  his  immediate  control.  (People  v.  Ting,
etc., G.R. Nos. 130568-69)

Tests for a valid warrantless search incidental to lawful arrest:
- item  to  searched  was  within  the  arrestee’s  custody  or  area  of
immediate control.
- the search was contemporaneous with the arrest. (Bernas p. 47)

b. When it involves prohibited articles in "plain view."

## Requisites:
- prior valid intrusion into a place;
- the evidence inadvertently discovered by the police who had the right
to be where they are;
- the legality of the evidence must be immediately apparent;
- is noticed without further search


c. Search of a moving vehicle.
Highly  regulated  by  the  government,  the  vehicle's  inherent  mobility
reduces   expectations   of   privacy   especially   when   its   transit   in   public
thoroughfares   furnishes   a   highly   reasonable   suspicion   amounting   to
probable cause that the occupant committed a criminal activity.

Probable   cause   for   warrantless   search   of   vehicles   (EXTENSIVE
## SEARCH).

Although the term eludes exact definition, probable cause
1)      signifies   a   reasonable   ground   of   suspicion   supported   by
circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious man’s
belief  that  the  person  accused  is  guilty  of  the  offense  with  which  he  is
charged; or
2)  the existence of such facts and circumstances which could lead a
reasonably  discreet  and  prudent  man  to  believe  that  an  offense  has  been
committed and that the items, articles or objects sought in connection with
said offense or subject to seizure and destruction by law is in the place to be
searched.

The required probable cause that will justify a warrantless search and
seizure is not  determined by a fixed formula but is resolved according to the
facts of each case.  (Caballes v. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. No. 136292,
## January 15, 2002)

ROUTINE  INSPECTIONS are not regarded as violative of an individual’s
right   against   unreasonable   search.      The   search   which   is   normally
permissible  is limited to the following instances:
a)  where the officer merely draws aside the curtain of a vacant vehicle
which is parked on the public fair grounds;
b)  simply looks into a vehicle;
c)  flashes a light therein without opening the car’s doors;
d)  where the occupants are not subjected to a physical or body search;
e)  where the inspection of the vehicles is limited to a visual search or
visual inspection; and
f)  where the routine check is conducted at a fixed area.  (Caballes v. Court
of Appeals, et al., G.R. No. 136292


d.  Consented warrantless search.


In   case   of   consented   searches   or   waiver   of   the   constitutional
guarantee, against obtrusive searches, it is fundamental that to constitute a
waiver, it must first appear that:
a. The right exists;
b. The person involved had knowledge, either actual or constructive,
of the existence of such right; and
c.  The said  person  had  an  actual  intention  to  relinquish  the  right.
(People v. Figueroa, et al., G.R. No. 124056)

Relevant to this determination are the following characteristics of the
person giving consent and the environment in which consent is given:
1)  The age of the defendant;
2) Whether he was in a public or secluded location;
3) Whether he objected to the search or passively looked on;
4) The education and intelligence of the defendant;
5) The presence of coercive police procedures;
6) The defendant’s belief that no incriminating evidence will be found;
the nature of the police questioning;
the environment in which the questioning took place; and
7)  the possibly vulnerable subjective state of the person consenting.
It  is  the  State  which  has  the  burden  of  proving,  by  clear  and  positive
testimony,  that  the  necessary  consent  was  obtained  and  that  it  was  freely
and  voluntarily  given.   (Caballes  v.  Court  of  Appeals,  et  al.,  G.R.  No.
## 136292)

A  peaceful  submission  to  a  search  or  seizure  is  not  consent  or  an
invitation thereto, but is merely a demonstration of regard for the supremacy
of the law.  (People v. Cubcubin)
Permission  granted  for  officers  to  enter  a  house  to  look  for  rebel
soldiers does not include permission for a room to room search. (Spouses
Veroy vs Layague GR 95632)

e.  Customs searches.  – Seizure of goods concealed to avoid  duties.
(Pacis vs Pamaran 56 SCRA 16)


People v. Escano, et al., G.R. Nos. 129756-58

REASONS  why  there is  no  necessity  for  the  Bureau  of  Customs  to
secure  a  judicial  search  warrant  where  the  place  to  be  searched  is  not  a
dwelling place:
1)  There should be no unnecessary hindrance on the government’s
drive to prevent smuggling and other frauds upon the Customs;

2)   To   render effective and efficient the collection of import and export
duties due the State, which enables the government to carry out the functions
it has been instituted to perform (Jao, et al., v. Court of Appeals, et al., and
companion case, 249 SCRA 35, 43); and

3)   The doctrine of primary jurisdiction.

Searches  without  warrant  of  automobiles  is  also  allowed  for  the
purpose of preventing violations of smuggling or immigration laws, provided
such searches are made at borders or ‘constructive borders’ like checkpoints
near the boundary lines of the State. (Caballes v. Court of Appeals, et al.,
G.R. No. 136292, January 15, 2002)

f. Terry search:

"Stop  and  frisk"  is  a  "limited  protective  search  of  outer  clothing  for
weapons."    While  probable  cause  is  not  required  to  conduct  a  "stop  and
frisk," mere suspicion or a hunch will not invalidate it. A GENUINE REASON
must  exist,  in  light  of  the  police  officer’s  experience  and  surrounding
conditions,  to  warrant  the  belief  that  the  person  detained  has  weapons
concealed about him. (Malacat v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 123595)

It serves a two-fold interest:

1)  the  general  interest  of  effective  crime  prevention  and  detection,
which underlies the recognition that a police officer may, under appropriate
circumstances  and  in  an  appropriate  manner,  approach  a  person  for
purposes of investigating possible criminal behavior even without probable
cause.

2)  the  more pressing  interest  of  safety  and  self-preservation  which
permit the police officer to take steps to assure himself that the person with
whom he deals is not armed with a deadly weapon that would unexpectedly
and fatally be used against the police officer. (Malacat vs CA)


g. Administrative Searches

– Inspection  of  buildings  and  other  premises  to  enforcement  of  fire,
sanitary, and building regulations. Camara vs Municipal Court 387 US 523
held that to sustain such searches without a search warrant; there must be
probable cause and urgency to justify the inspection.

h. Warrantless search arising from exigent circumstance

This was applied in People vs De Gracia GR 102009-10 where there
were intelligence reports that the buikding was being used as headquarters
by  the  RAM  during  the  1989  coup  d  etat.  Surveillance  indicated  rebel
activities in the building. Nearby courts were closed and general chaos and
disorder   prevailed.   Under   these   situations,   the   raiding   team   had   no
opportunity to apply foor and secure a search warrant from the courts. Under
such  urgency  and  exigency  of  the  moment,  a  search  warrant  should  be
lawfully be dispensed with.

>Property to  be  searched need  not  be  owned  by  the person  against
whom  the  search  warrant  is  directed.  Sufficient  that  the  property  is  under
control or possession of the person sought to be searched.

d. Warrantless Arrests

A  peace  officer  or  a  private  person  may,  without  warrant,  arrest  a
person:
(a)    When  in  his  presence,  the  person  to  be  arrested  has
committed,  is  actually  committing  or  is  attempting  to  commit  an
offense.

Requisites for valid in flagrante warrantless arrest
- The person to be arrested must execute an overt act indicating that he
a. has just committed,
b. is actually committing, or
c.  is attempting to commit a crime; and;
-   Such  overt  act  is  done  in  the  presence  or  within  the  view  of  the
arresting officer.  (People v. Molina, G.R. No. 133917)

Entrapment; when allowed


Where  the  criminal  intent  originates  in  the  mind  of  the  entrapping
person and the accused is lured into the commission of the offense charged
in  order too  prosecute him,  there  is  entrapment  and  no conviction may  be
had.

Where the criminal intent originates in the mind of the accused and the
criminal  offense  is completed, the  fact  that  a  person  acting  as  a  decoy for
the  state,  or  public  officials  furnished  the  accused  an  opportunity  for
commission of the offense, or that the accused is aided in the commission of
the crime in order to secure the evidence necessary to prosecute him, there
is no entrapment and the accused must be convicted. (People vs Doria GR
## 125299)

(b)  When an offense has in fact just been committed, and he has
probable  cause  to  believe  based  on  personal  knowledge  of  facts  or
circumstances  that the person to be arrested has committed it (Rule
113 Sec 5 ROC)

Personal knowledge of facts” in warrantless arrest must be based upon
probable  cause,  which  means  an  actual  belief  or  reasonable  ground  of
suspicion.

Person charged with rebellion, subversion, conspiracy or proposal to
commit  such crimes,  and  crimes  or  offenses  committed  in  furtherance
thereof may be arrested without a warrant these being continuing offenses
and therefore the accused are assumed to be always continuing the offense.
(Umil vs Ramos GR 81567)

(c)  When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped
from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment
or  is  temporarily  confined  while  his  case  is  pending,  or  has  escaped
while being transferred from one confinement to another.

In  cases  falling  under  paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  above,  the  person
arrested without a warrant shall be forthwith delivered to the nearest police
station or jail and shall be proceeded against in accordance with section 7 of
Rule 112.  (Sec. 5, Rule 113, ROC)

Remedies for unlawful arrest:


a.  Motion for the quashal of the warrant;
b.  Motion for reinvestigation.

Instances considered as waiver of illegal arrest:

1)  Failure to challenge the validity of the arrest and search, as well as
the admission of the  evidence  obtained thereby,  is considered  a  waiver  of
the  constitutional  rights,  particularly  against  unreasonable  searches  and
seizures. (People v. Cuison, et al., G.R. No. 109287)

2)    Any  irregularity  attendant  to  the  arrest  was  cured  by voluntary
submission  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  trial  court  upon  entering  a  plea  and
participation during the trial. (People v. Tumaneng, G.R. No. 117624)

3)  The filing of charges and the subsequent issuance of a warrant of
arrest against a person invalidly detained will cure the defect of that detention
or at least deny him the right to be released because of such defect. (The
minor Larranaga, et al., v. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. No. 130644)

4)  Failure to question the legality of the arrest before arraignment is
deemed  a  waiver  of  such  defense.   (People  v.  Deang,  et  al.,  G.R.  No.
## 128045)

e) Administrative arrests

Warrant of arrest may be issued by administrative authorities only for
the purpose of carrying out a final finding of a violation of law, like an order
of  deportation  or  an  order  of  contempt,  and  not  for  the  sole  purpose  of
investigation or prosecution. – It may be issued only after the proceeding has
taken  place  as  when  there  is  already  a  final decision of the  administrative
authorities.  The  requirement  of  probable  cause,  to  be  determined  by  the
Judge,  does  not  extend  to  deportation  proceedings. (Morano  vs  Vivo  20
## SCRA 562)

In the case of Harvey vs Santiago 162 SCRA 840, it was held that the
arrest is a step preliminary to the deportation of the aliens who had violated
the  conditions  of  their  stay  in  this  country.  To  rule  otherwise  would  be  to
render the authority given the Commissioner nugatory to the detriment of the
## State.


f) Drug, Alcohol, and Blood Tests

Doctrine in SJS vs DDB
Drug Testing of those charged with a crime
We find the situation entirely different in the case of persons charged
before the public prosecutor's office with criminal offenses punishable with
six (6) years and one (1) day imprisonment. The operative concepts in the
mandatory drug testing are "randomness" and "suspicionless." In the case
of persons charged with a crime before the prosecutor's office, a mandatory
drug testing can never be random or suspicionless. The ideas of randomness
and being suspicionless are antithetical to their being made defendants in a
criminal complaint. They are not randomly picked; neither are they beyond
suspicion. When persons suspected of committing a crime are charged, they
are  singled  out  and  are  impleaded  against  their will.  The  persons  thus
charged, by the bare fact of being haled before the prosecutor's office and
peaceably submitting themselves to drug testing, if that be the case, do not
necessarily consent to the procedure, let alone waive their right to privacy.
## 40

To  impose  mandatory  drug  testing  on  the  accused  is  a  blatant  attempt  to
harness  a  medical  test  as  a  tool  for  criminal  prosecution,  contrary  to  the
stated objectives  of  RA  9165.  Drug  testing  in  this  case  would  violate  a
persons' right to privacy guaranteed under Sec. 2, Art. III of the Constitution.
Worse   still,   the   accused   persons   are   veritably   forced   to   incriminate
themselves.

Random Drug Test for students and public and private employees

As  the  warrantless  clause  of  Sec.  2,  Art  III  of  the  Constitution  is
couched and as has been held, "reasonableness" is the touchstone of the
validity of a government search or intrusion. And whether a search at issue
hews  to  the  reasonableness  standard  is  judged  by  the  balancing  of  the
government - mandated intrusion on the individual's privacy interest against
the  promotion  of  some  compelling  state  interest.  In  the  criminal  context,
reasonableness  requires  showing  of  probable  cause  to  be  personally
determined by a judge. Given that the drug - testing policy for employees--
and students for that matter--under RA 9165 is in the nature of administrative
search  needing  what  was  referred  to  in Vernonia as  "swift  and  informal
disciplinary  procedures,"  the  probable - cause  standard  is  not  required  or
even  practicable.  Be  that  as  it  may,  the  review  should  focus  on  the
reasonableness of the challenged administrative search in question.


To reiterate, RA 9165 was enacted as a measure to stamp out illegal
drug in the country and thus protect the well - being of the citizens, especially
the youth, from the deleterious effects of dangerous drugs. The law intends
to  achieve  this  through  the  medium,  among  others,  of  promoting  and
resolutely  pursuing  a  national  drug  abuse  policy  in  the  workplace  via  a
mandatory  random  drug test. To  the Court,  the  need  for  drug testing to  at
least  minimize  illegal  drug  use  is  substantial  enough  to  override  the
individual's privacy interest under the premises. The Court can consider that
the  illegal  drug  menace  cuts  across  gender,  age  group,  and  social -
economic lines. And it may not be amiss to state that the sale, manufacture,
or trafficking of illegal drugs, with their ready market, would be an investor's
dream  were  it  not  for  the  illegal  and  immoral  components  of  any  of  such
activities. The drug problem has hardly abated since the martial law public
execution of a notorious drug trafficker. The state can no longer assume a
laid   back   stance   with   respect   to this   modern - day   scourge.   Drug
enforcement  agencies  perceive  a  mandatory  random  drug  test  to  be  an
effective  way  of  preventing  and  deterring  drug  use  among  employees  in
private offices, the threat of detection by random testing being higher than
other modes. The Court holds that the chosen method is a reasonable and
enough means to lick the problem.

Taking  into  account  the  foregoing  factors,  i.e.,  the  reduced  expectation  of
privacy on the part of the employees, the compelling state concern likely to
be  met  by  the  search,  and  the  well - defined  limits  set  forth  in  the  law  to
properly guide authorities in the conduct of the random testing, we hold that
the challenged drug test requirement is, under the limited context of the case,
reasonable and, ergo, constitutional.




## Blood Tests

US Cases
In the criminal context, reasonableness usually requires a showing of
probable cause. The probable-cause standard, however, is peculiarly related
to   criminal   investigations   and   may   be   unsuited   to   determining   the
reasonableness of administrative searches where the Government seeks to
prevent the development of hazardous conditions. The American Court has

held  that  a  warrant  and  finding  of  probable  cause  are  unnecessary  in  the
public school context because such requirements would unduly interfere with
the  maintenance  of  the  swift  and  informal  disciplinary  procedures that  are
needed. (Board of Education vs Earls No. 01332 June 27 2002)

However, it was held in Skinner vs Railway Labor Executives’ Assn
[489 US 602 (1989)], that requiring a person to submit urine or blood, or to
undergo  breathalyzer  testing  for  the  purpose  of  determining  whether  he  is
under the influence of alcohol or drugs are considered a species of search
that  is  governed  by  the  constitutional  proscription  against  unreasonable
searches and seizures. (Meaning PROBABLE CAUSE or an Individualized
Suspicion is Required)

The  exception  to  this  is  the  doctrine  under US  vs  Martinez-Fuerte
(428  US  560) where  it  was  held  that,  in  limited  circumstances,  where  the
privacy  interests  implicated  by  the  search  are  minimal  and  where  an
important governmental interest furthered by the intrusion would be placed
in  jeopardy  by a  requirement  of  individualized  suspicion,  a  search may  be
reasonable despite the absence of such suspicion. (probably the reason why
we have the US case of  BOE vs Earls)




What it covers: Letters, messages, telephone calls, telegrams and the
like. (p. 56 Bernas)

Intrusion allowed: Lawful order of the court, or when public safety or
order requires otherwise as prescribed by law.

Grounds  when  a  court  may  allow  intrusion: Requirement  of
probable cause. (p 56 Bernas)

Requisites when intrusion is made without judicial order:
a) Must be based on the government official’s assessment that public
safety and order demand such intrusion.
b)  The  exercise  of  this  power  by  an executive  officer  is  subject  to
judicial review.
c)  Such  executive  officer  must  be  properly  authorized  except  the
## President.
## 6. PRIVACY     OF     COMMUNICATIONS     AND
## CORRESPONDENCE



> Exclusionary Rule applies
> The right is personal.
See RA 4200

a) Private and Public communications
Navarro vs CA 313 SCRA 153
Thus,  the  law  prohibits  the  overhearing,  intercepting,  or  recording
private communications (RA 4200). Since the exchange between petitioner
Navarro  and  Lingan  was  not  private,  its  tape  recording  is  not  prohibited,
hence, admissible in evidence.

In Chavez vs Gonzales, the airing of the Garci Tapes does not violate
the  right  to  privacy  because  the  content  of  the  Garci  Tapes  is  a  matter  of
important public concern – the Constitution guarantees the people’s right to
information  on  matters  of  public concern  (even  if  the  communications
between GMA and Garci are private in nature.)

In the case of Garcillano vs House of Rep (575 SCRA 170), it was
held that a private communication is characterized as such based not on the
content of the communication, but on the context that it was said in private
and not for public consumption. The nature of the conversations is immaterial
to  a  violation  of  the  statute  (RA  4200  or  Anti-Wiretapping  Law).  The
substance of the same need not be alleged in the information. What RA 4200
penalizes  are  the  acts  of  secretly  overhearing,  intercepting,  or  recording
private communications by means of devices enumerated therein. According
to Senate deliberations re this statute, what is contemplated in the law is the
communication  between  one  person  and  another  person – not  between  a
speaker and a public. Says Senator Tanada (author of the law), “Because
precisely, the speaker speaks so that the public may know what he has in
mind, what he wants to communicate to the people, and there should be no
objection to tape recording that speech..”RA 4200 however provides for
exceptions when wiretapping is allowed by written order of the court under
its Section 3. When legal – when done with consent of the parties or lawful
court order. Notably, in the exceptions to the right in Art III Section 3, no law
has been passed except RA 4200 depicting the phrase “when public safety
or order requires otherwise as PRESCRIBED BY LAW”.

b) Writ of Habeas Data


The  writ  of  habeas  data  was  conceptualized as  a  judicial  remedy
enforcing  the  right  to  privacy,  most  especially  the  right  to  informational
privacy of individuals. The writ operates to protect a person’s right to control
information  regarding  himself,  particularly  in  the  instances  where  such
information  is  being  collected  through  unlawful  means  in  order  to  achieve
unlawful ends.

An indispensable requirement before the privilege of the writ may be
extended  is  the  showing,  at  least  by  substantial  evidence,  of  an  actual  or
threatened  violation  of  the right  to  privacy  in  life,  liberty  or  security  of  the
victim.

Meralco vs Lim GR 184769

The habeas data rule, in general, is designed to protect by means of
judicial  complaint  the  image,  privacy,  honor,  information,  and  freedom  of
information of an individual. It is meant to provide a forum to enforce one’s
right  to  the  truth  and  to  informational  privacy,  thus  safeguarding  the
constitutional  guarantees  of  a  person’s  right  to  life,  liberty  and  security
against abuse in this age of information technology.

It  bears  reiteration  that  like  the  writ  of  amparo,  habeas  data  was
conceived as a response, given the lack of effective and available remedies,
to  address  the  extraordinary  rise  in  the  number  of  killings  and  enforced
disappearances. Its intent is to address violations of or threats to the rights
to  life,  liberty  or  security  as  a  remedy  independently  from  those  provided
under prevailing Rules



Concept and Scope

In Blo  Umpar  Adiong  vs  COMELEC,  it  was  held  that  freedom  of
expression  is  the  matrix,  the  indispensable  condition  of  nearly  every  other
freedom.  Under this  guarantee,  the  people  are  to  determine  their  own
direction and chart their own destiny through the free exchange of ideas and
not through dictation from or coercion of the government or anybody else’s.


## 7. FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION


Historically,  the  guarantees  of  free  expression  were  intended  to
provide  some  assurance  that  government  would  remain  responsive  to  the
will  of  the  people,  in  line  with  the  constitutional  principle  that  sovereignty
resides with the people and all government authority emanates from them.
(Gonzales vs COMELEC 27 SCRA 835 Sep.Opinion )

The  doctrine  of  freedom  of  speech  was  formulated  primarily  for  the
protection of the “core speech”, speech which communicates political, social,
or   religious   ideas.   It   does   not   apply   to   commercial   speech   or   the
communication  which  no  more  than  proposes  a  commercial  transaction.
(Beda Reviewer 2010 p. 19)

Scope: Any  and  all  modes  of  expression  are  embraced  in  the
guaranty. (Nachura p. 147)

## Prior Restraint

Prior restraint means official government restrictions on the press or
other forms of expression in advance of actual publication or dissemination.

## Forms:
- System of licensing administered by an executive officer
- Movie censorship
- Press censorship
- Judicial prior restraint – takes form of an injunction against publication
(Bernas p. 58)

There  need  not  be  total  suppression;  even  restriction  of  circulation
constitutes censorship. (Grossjean vs American Press 297 US 233)

Power of  MTRCB can be exercised only for purposes of classification,
not censorship.

Live  TV  Coverage  may  be  prohibited  since  the  right  of  the  accused
must  prevail  over  the  right  of  the  public  to  information  and  freedom  of  the
press. (AM No. 01-4-03-SC)
Can  only  be  justified  under  the  clear  and  present  danger  test. (Viva
Productions vs CA GR 123881)

O’Brien test – a governmental regulation is valid if:


a) it is within the constitutional power of the government;
b) it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest;
c)  the  governmental  interest  is  unrelated  to  the  suppression  of
expression;
d)  the  incidental  restriction  on  the  freedom  is  no  greater  than  is
essential to the furtherance of that interest.

In  the  case  of Chavez  vs Gonzales, (545  SCRA  4451),  it  was  held
that the alleged violation of the Anti-Wiretapping Law is not in itself a ground
to  impose  a  prior  restraint  on  the  airing  of  the  Garci  Tapes  because  the
Constitution expressly prohibits the enactment of any law, and that includes
anti-wiretapping laws, curtailing freedom of expression

## Subsequent Punishment

Freedom  from  subsequent  punishment  is  not  absolute,  and  may  be
properly regulated in the interest of the public. The State may validly impose
penal and/or admin sanctions such as the following:

A. Libel – Art 353 RPC.There is presumption of malice here with exceptions
under the RPC provision. The remedy of the person libeled is to show proof
that an article was written with the author’s knowledge that it was false or
with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not. (Baguio Midland vs
## CA GR 107566.)

## B. Obscenity

Tests of Obscenity:
-  whether the average person, applying contemporary standards, would
find the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;
- whether  the  work  depicts  or  describes,  in  a  patently  offensive  way,
sexual conduct specifically defined by law;
- whether  the  work,  taken  as  a  whole,  lacks  serious  literary,  artistic,
political or scientific value.

Determination as to what is obscene is a judicial function.

C. Fighting words – those which by their very utterance, inflict injury or tend
to incite an immediate breach of the peace – since they are no essential part

of any exposition of ideas, are of such slight social value as a step to truth
that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the
social interest in order and morality. (Chaplinsky vs New Hampshire 315
## US 568)



Content-Based and Content-Neutral Regulations

a) Content-based Regulations

These restrictions are imposed because of the content of the speech
itself;  distort  public  debate,  have  improper  motivation,  and  are  usually
imposed because of fear how people will react to a particular speech. This
is subject to a clear-and-present danger rule. (p. 171 Duka)

xxx  what to read or see or hear, regulations which are content-based
– those  which  either  approve  or  disapprove  based  on  the  contents  of  the
expression,  such  a  favoring  or  disfavoring  some  topics – are  subjected  to
strict scrutiny, ie the government is required to justify them by the presence
of  a  compelling  state  interest  and  a  showing  of  an  absence  of  any  other
means by which the state objective could be attained. These restrictions, it
will be seen, are censorial and therefore they bear a heavy presumption of
constitutional   invalidity.   In   addition,   they   will   be   tested   for   possible
overbreadth and vagueness. (Osmeña vs COMELEC 288 SCRA 447)

b) Content-Neutral Regulations

These restrictions are not concerned with the content of speech. These
regulations need only a substantial governmental interest to support them. A
deferential standard of review will suffice to test their validity. The restriction
simply regulates the time, place or manner of the dissemination of speech or
expression.

c)  Facial  Challenges  and  the  Overbreadth  Doctrine (government  act
necessary)

Facial Challenge - The established rule is that a party can question
the validity of a statute only if, as applied to him, it is unconstitutional. The
exception  is the  so-called  facial  challenge.  But  the  ONLY  time  a  facial

challenge to a statute is allowed is when it operates in the area of freedom
of expression. In such instance, the “overbreadth doctrine” permits a party to
challenge  the  validity  of  a  statute  even though,  as  applied  to  him,  it  is  not
unconstitutional.  Invalidation of  the  statute  “on  its  face”,  rather  than  “as
applied”,  is  permitted  in  the  interest  of  preventing  a  “chilling  effect”  on
freedom oof expression. (Cruz vs DENR GR 135385.)

A facial challenge to a legislative act is the most difficult challenge to
mount  successfully  since  the  challenge  must  establish  that  no  set  of
circumstances  exists  under  which  the  act  would  be  valid. (Estrada  vs
Sandiganbayan   GR   148560). (Termed   as   facial review   USING   the
overbreadth doctrine in the case of David vs Macapagal-Arroyo)
In the latter case, the following doctrines were made:
- The overbreadth doctrine is an analytical tool developed for testing on
their face statutes in free speech cases, not for testing the validity of a
law that reflects legitimate state interest in maintaining comprehensive
control over harmful, constitutionally unprotected conduct.

- Facial invalidation of laws is considered a manifestly strong medicine,
to be used sparingly and only as a last resort.

In the case of Romualdez vs COMELEC (573 SCRA 639), it was held
that only statutes on free speech, religious freedom and other fundamental
rights may be facially challenged; Under no case may ordinary penal statutes
be subjected to facial challenges.


Overbreadth Doctrine – prohibits the government from achieving its
purpose    by    means    that    sweep    unnecessarily    broadly,    reaching
constitutionally  protected  as  well  as  unprotected  activity.  The  essence  of
“overbreadth” is that the government has gone too far; its legitimate interest
can  be  satisfied  without  reachingso  broadly  into  the  area  of  protected
freedom. (p 152 Nachura.)

The  SC  in  one  case  held  that  a  statute  or  regulation  is  void  for
overbreadth  when  it  offends  the  constitutional  principle  that  a  government
purpose  to  control  or  prevent  activities  constitutionally  subject  to  State
regulation may not be achieved by means that sweep unnecessarily broadly
and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms. (Chavez vs COMELEC
## 437 SCRA 415).


In the case of Romualdez vs COMELEC (553 SCRA 370), it was held
that  overbreadth  and  vagueness  doctrines  may  be  applied  to  free  speech
cases and penal statutes as well.

d) Tests
It  is accepted  view  that  prior  restraint can  only be  justified  under the
clear and present danger test. (refer to discussions above) In Schanck vs
US (No. 437, 438), it was held that the test is used when words are used in
such  circumstance  and  of  such  nature  as  to  create  a  clear  and  present
danger that will bring about the substantive evil that the State has the right
to prevent.
Clear – Causal  connection  with  the  danger  of  the  substantive  evil
arising from the utterance questioned.
Present – time  element,  identified  with  imminent  and  immediate
danger;  the  danger  must  not  only  be  probable,  but  very  likely  inevitable.
(Gonzales vs COMELEC Np. L – 27833)

In “subsequent punishment”, however, there are three tests which
are
1) Clear and Present Danger Test;
2) Dangerous Tendency Test; and
3) Balancing of Interests Test.

Dangerous Tendency Test – In Cabansag vs Fernandez (102 Phil 152) if
the words  uttered create  a  dangerous  tendency  of  an  evil which  the  State
has the right to prevent, then such words are punishable. It is sufficient if the
natural tendency and the probable effect of the utterance were to bring about
the substantive evil that the legislative body seeks to prevent.

Balancing of Interests Test – When particular conduct is regulated in
the  interest of  public  order,  and  the  regulation  results  in  an  indirect,
conditional,  or  partial  abridgment  of  speech, the  duty  of  the  courts  is  to
determine  which  of  the  two  conflicting  interests  demands  the  greater
protection   under   the   particular   circumstances   presented. (American
Communications Assoc vs Douds 339 US 282).

It requires a court to take conscious and detailed consideration of the
interplay   of   interests   observable   in   a   given   situation. (Zaldivar   vs
## Sandiganbayan.)


The  test  applied  when  two  legitimate  values  not  involving  national
secuirty   crimes   compete.  Involves    an    appoint    of   the    competing
interest.  (Gonzales v. Comelec).

In Aver  v.  Capulong  and  Enrile,  for  instance,  it  is  a  question  of
balancing the freedom of expression of the producer and the right to privacy
of Enrile.

Grave-but-improbable  danger:  Whether  the  gravity  of  the  evil,
discounted by its improbability, justifies such an invasion of free speech as
is  necessary  to  avoid  the  danger. (Dennis  v.  United  States,  341  US  494
(1951), quoting Judge Learned Hand.)

This test was meant to supplant the clear and present danger.  They
both emphasize the circumstances of the speech, but this latter test consider
the weighing of values.

Direct Incitement Test:  The constitutional guarantees of free speech
and press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of
force or of law violation, except where such advocacy or speech is directed
to  inciting  or  producing  imminent  lawless  action,  and  is  likely  to  incite  or
produce such action.  [Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), cited in
Salonga v. Cruz Pano, 134 SCRA 438 (1985).]

The test emphasizes the very words uttered:
(a) What words did he utter?
(b)  What is the likely result of such utterance?
It criticizes the clear and present danger test for being too dependent
on the circumstances.  Speaker may, when tested show no incitement but
you know the speaker is inciting to sedition.

State Regulation of Different Types of Mass Media

Depending  on  the  form  and  medium  in  which  speech  is  being
exercised, to that extent may it also affect the extent of governmental power
expended. Thus the power applied is not the same in regard to regulation of
pure  speech  as  against  expressive  conduct,  the  print  media  vis-à-vis  the
broadcast  media,  or  that  between  TV  and  movies.  In  the  same  way,
differences in situation between a daily newspaper and a weekly magazine

may call for a different standard of diligence which would affect the liability
of damages. Further, while mere possession of obscene materials might not
be criminalized, it would be an entirely different matter if the material involves
child pornography.

Relevant cases:

Pure speech vs Expressive speech

The  government  generally  has  a  freer  hand  in  restricting  expressive
conduct  than  it  has  in  restricting  the  written  or  spoken  word. (Texas  vs
Johnson 491 US 397)

Print vs Broadcast media

All forms of media, whether print or broadcast, are entitled to the broad
protection  of  the  freedom  of  speech  and  expression  clause.  The  test  for
limitations on freedom of expression continues to be the clear and present
danger rule. The clear and present danger test, however, does not lend itself
to a simplistic and all embracing  interpretations applicable to all utterances
in all forums.

All forms of communication are entitled to the broad protection of the
freedom  of  expression  clause.  Necessarily,  however,  the  freedom  of
television  and  radio  broadcasting  is  somewhat  lesser  in  scope  than  the
freedom accorded to newspaper and print media.

In  American  Court  in Federal  Communications  Commission  vs
Pacifica (438  US  726),  it  was  held  by  the  US  SC  that  radio  broadcasting
receives the most limited protection from the free expression clause. First,
broadcast media have established a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives
of all citizens. Material presented over the airwaves confronts the citizen, not
only  in  public,  but  in  the  privacy  of  his  home.  Second,  broadcasting  is
uniquely  accessible  to  children.  Bookstores  and  motion  pictures  theaters
may be prohibited from making certain material available to children, but the
same selectivity cannot be done in radio or TV, where the listener or viewer
is  constantly  turning  in  and  out.     (Eastern  Broadcasting  vs  Dans  137
## SCRA 628)


While all forms of communication are entitled to the broad protection
of  freedom  of  expression  clause,  the  freedom  of  film,  television  and  radio
broadcasting  is  somewhat  lesser  in  scope  than  the  freedom  accorded  to
newspapers and other print media. (Chavez vs Gonzales)

The  broadcast  media  have  also  established  a  uniquely  pervasive
presence  in  the  lives  of  all Filipinos.  Newspapers  and  current  books  are
found  only  in  metropolitan  areas  and  in  the  poblaciones  of  municipalities
accessible  to  fast  and  regular  transportation.  Even  here,  there  are  low
income  masses  who  find  the  cost  of  books,  newspapers,  and  magazines
beyond their humble means. Basic needs like food and shelter perforce enjoy
higher priorities.

On the otheRhand, the transistor radio is found everywhere. The TV
set  is  also  becoming  universal.  Their  message  may  be  simultaneously
received  by  a  national  or  regional  audience  or  listeners  including  the
indifferent and the unwilling who happen to be within reach of a blaring radio
or TV set. Unlike readers of the printed work, the radio audience has lesser
opportunity to cogitate analyze, and reject the utterance.

Re Broadcast vs Printed media

## 1
st
, the difference in treatment, in the main, is in the regulatory scheme
applied  to  broadcast  media  that  is  not  imposed  on  traditional  print  media,
and  narrowly  confined  to  unprotected  speech  (e.g. obscenity,  porno,
seditious  and  inciting  speech)  or  is  based  on  a  compelling  government
interest that also has constitutional protection, such as national security or
the electoral process.

## 2
nd
,  regardless  of  the  regulatory  schemes  that  broadcast  media  is
subjected  to,  the  Court  has  consistently  held  that  the  clear  and  present
danger test applies to content-based restrictions on media, without making
a   distinction   as   to   traditional   print   or   broadcast   media. (Chavez   vs
## Gonzales.)

## Internet

Internet   remains   largely   unregulated,   yet   the   Internet   and   the
broadcast  media  share  similarities,  and  the  rationales  used  to  support
broadcast regulation apply equally to the Internet. Thus, it has been argued

that courts, legislative bodies and the government agencies regulating media
must  agree  to  regulate  both,  regulate  neither  or  develop  a  new  regulatory
framework  and  rationale  to  justify  the  differential  treatment. (Chavez  vs
## Gonzales.)

TV and movies

All that remains to be said is that the ruling is to be limited to the concept of
obscenity applicable to motion pictures. It is the consensus of this Court that
where television is concerned: a less liberal approach calls for observance.
This is so because unlike motion pictures where the patrons have to pay their
way, television reaches every home where there is a set. Children then will
likely will be among the avid viewers of the programs therein shown. As was
observed by Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerome Frank, it is hardly the
concern of the law to deal with the sexual fantasies of the adult population.
It cannot be denied though that the State as parens patriae is called upon to
manifest  an  attitude  of  caring  for  the  welfare  of  the  young. (Gonzales  vs
Kalaw Katigbak 137 SCRA 717)

Daily and weekly magazines
Pressure of deadline not a defense in libelous application in a weekly
magazine..  While  a  newspaper  should  not  be  held  to  account  for  honest
mistakes owing to the pressure of a daily deadline, there is no such pressure
to meet and no occasion to act with haste in a weekly magazine. (Lopez vs
CA 34 SCRA 116 (1970) Halos end..No. 3)

## Commercial Speech

Commercial  Speech – It  is  a  communication  which  no  more  than
proposes a commercial transaction Advertisement of goods or services is an
example.
To   enjoy   protection,   commercial   speech   must   not   be   false   or
misleading (Friedman  vs  Rogers  440  US  1) and  should  not propose  an
illegal  transaction. (Pittsburgh  Press  vs  Human  Relations  Commission
## 413 US 376.)

However,   even   truthful   and   lawful   commercial   speech   may   be
regulated if:
- Government has substantial interest to protect
- The regulation directly advances that interest

- It  is  not  more  extensive  than  is  necessary  to  protect  the  interest.
(Central Hudson vs Public Service Commission No 79-565. )

Private and Government Speech (?)

## Heckler’s Veto
It is where, literally, the opposition of a rowdy or obstreperous crowd
might as well drown out the voice of the one seeking to exercise the right to
speak. In legal context, that might come in the form  of regulations tending
to  prevent  the  expression  of  an  idea  in  view  of  the  reaction  that  might  be
engendered among those opposed to it. This may be in the guise of a permit
requirement in the holding of rallies, parades or demonstrations conditioned
on the payment of a fee computed on the basis of the cost needed to keep
order in view of the expected opposition by persons holding contrary views .
(Forsyth County vs Nationalist Movement. 505 US 123)



Art. III, Sec. 5.  No law shall be made respecting an establishment of
religion;  or  prohibiting  the  free  exercise  thereof.  The  free  exercise  and
enjoyment  of  religious  profession  and  worship,  without discrimination  or
preference, shall forever be allowed.  No religious test shall be required for
the exercise of civil or political rights.

a.  Non-Establishment Clause

The  clause  prohibits  excessive  government  entanglement  with,
endorsement  or  disapproval  of  religion. (Victoriano  v.  Elizalde  Rope
Workers Union 59 SCRA 54)
The  clause   prohibits  the   State  from   establishing   a  religion.  In
assessing the validity of the law, the questions to be asked are:
a.   Is the purpose of the law religious, or is it secular?
b.   Does it or does it not inhibit or advance religion?
c.   Is  its  effect  to  promote  or  to  avoid  an  excessive entanglement
between the State and religious matters in religion?

The Non-Establishment clause is violated when the State gives any
manifest  support  to  any  one  religion,  even  if  nothing  is  done  against  the
individual.

## 8. FREEDOM OF RELIGION


Purpose of the NE Clause

Voluntarism  and  insulation  of  the  political  process  from  interfaith
dissension.

Other Constitutional provisions which support the non-establishment
clause:
Sec  2(5),  Article  IX-C (A  religious  sect  or  denomination  cannot  be
registered a a political party)
Sec  5(2),  Article  VI (No  sectoral  representative  from  the  religious
sector)
Sec 29(2), Article VI (Prohibition against the use of public money or
property for the benefit of religion, or of any priest, minister, or ecclesiastic)

Exceptions to the NE Clause: (p. 60 Nachura)

Sec  28(3),  Art  VI (exemption  from  taxation  of  properties  ADE  for
religious purposes)
Sec   4(2),   Article   XIV (citizenship   requirement   of   ownership   of
educational institutions  except  those  established  by  religious  groups  and
mission boards)
Sec 3(3), Article XIV (optional religious instruction)
Sec 29(2) Article VI (appropriation allowed to minister or ecclesiastic)

## Scope:
- The State cannot set-up a church
- The  State  cannot  pass  laws  which  aid  one  religion,  all  religions  or
prefer one over another.
- The State cannot influence a person to remain or to go away from a
church against his will.
- The State cannot force a person to profess a belief or disbelief in any
religion. (p. 212-213 Duka)

Intramural  religious  dispute – Where  a  civil  right  depends  upon  some
matter pertaining to ecclesiastical affairs, the civil tribunal tries the civil right
and nothing more. (Gonzales vs Archbishop 51 Phil 420)
In  matters  purely  ecclesiastical  the  decisions  of  the  proper  church
tribunals are conclusive upon the civil tribunal. (Long and Almeria vs Basa
## GR 134963-64.)


While  the  State  is  prohibited  from  interfering  in  purely  ecclesiastical
affairs, the Church is likewise barred from meddling in purely secular matters.
(Austria vs NLRC GR 124382).
Ecclesiastical affair – one that concerns doctrine, creed or form of worship
of the church, or the adoption and enforcement within a religious association
of needful laws and regulations for the government of the membership, and
the  power  of  excluding  from  such  associations  those  deemed  unworthy  of
membership. (p. 162 Nachura)

When is government aid allowable?
When all the following requisites are present:
- must have a secular legislative purpose
- must have a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion
- must not require excessive entanglement with recipient institutions.

b) Free Exercise  clause

## Aspects:
- Freedom to believe – Absolute
- Freedom to act according to one’s belief –
Where the individual externalizes his beliefs in acts or omissions that
affect the public, his freedom to do so becomes subject to the authority of
the State.
The  exercise  of  religious  freedom  does  not  exempt  anyone  from
compliance with reasonable requirements of the law, including civil service
laws. (AM No. 02-2-10 SC)

## Compelling State Interest Test

In applying the test:
## The 1
st
inquiry is whether respondent’s right to religious freedom has
been burdened.
## The 2
nd
step is to ascertain respondent’s sincerity in her religious belief.
## The  3
rd
inquiry  is  whether  there  is  a  compelling  state  interest  the
burden  of  evidence  of  which  must  be  discharged  by  the  government.
(Estrada vs Escritor; AM No P-02-1651)

Compelling means that the violation will erode the very fabric of the
state that will also protect the freedom. (Estrada vs Escritor; AM No P-02-
## 1651)


The  constitution’s  religion  clauses  prescribe  not strict but benevolent
neutrality. Benevolent neutrality recognizes that government must pursue its
secular goals and interests, but at the same time, strive to uphold religious
liberty  to  the  greatest  extent  possible  within  flexible  constitutional  limits.
(Estrada vs Escritor; AM No P-02-1651)

Some doctrines:
Ebralinag vs Division upheld the petitioner’s right of the petitioners to
refuse to salute the Philippine flag on account of religious scruples
Invocation of religious scruples in order to avoid military service was
brushed by the SC in People vs Zosa
SC  upheld  the  validity of  RA  3350,  exempting  members  of  religious
sect from being compelled to join a labor union.
This guarantee includes the right to disseminate religious information,
and any restraint on such right can be justified only on the ground of clear-
and-present-danger test.




Art  13(2)  UDHR, - provide  that  everyone  has  the  right  to  leave  any
country, including his own, and to return to his country.
Art  12 (4),  Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political  Rights provide  that  no
one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country.

Liberty guaranteed by the Constitutional provision

Freedom to choose and change one’s place of abode. (See RA 8368
and RA 7279)

Freedom to travel both within the country and outside.  (Bernas p. 89)

## Purpose
To further emphasize the individual’s liberty as safeguarded in general
terms in the due process clause. (p 168 Cruz 2000 ed.)

Squatting now decriminalized under RA 8368 (Duka p. 222)

## Limitations
## 9.   LIBERTY   OF   ABODE   AND   FREEDOM   OF
## MOVEMENT


Limitations on liberty of abode – lawful order of the Court

Some recognized exceptions to the right
- A lessee may be judicially ejected for violation of his contractual duties
- Forced evacuation in volcanic eruption. (p. 169 Cruz 2000 ed)
- Rubi vs Provincial Board of Mindoro requiring non-Christian to reside
in a reservation (validated by the court under PP)

Limitations  on  the  liberty  to  travel – Interest  of  national  security,
public safety, or public health, as may be provided by law; including lawful
order  of  the  court  (as  when  an  accused  is  released  on  bail). (Nachura  p.
## 165)

While  the  liberty  of  travel  may  be  impaired  even without court  order,
the appropriate executive officers or administrative authorities are not armed
with arbitrary discretion to impose limitations. They can impose limits only on
the basis of national security, public safety, or public health and as may be
provided by law. (Manotoc vs CA 142 SCRA 149)

Re: Hold Departure Order. In Defensor-Santiago vs Vasquez  (217
SCRA 633), the Court further clarified the foregoing principles:
1) HDO is but an exercise of the court’s inherent power to preserve
and maintain the effectiveness of its jurisdiction over the case and over the
person of the accused,
2) by posting bail, the accused holds herself amenable to the orders
and processes of the court thus, she may be legally prohibited from leaving
the country,
3) parties with pending cases should apply for permission to leave the
country from the same courts

Some recognized exceptions to the right

- A  person facing  criminal  charges  may  be  restrained  by  the  court  from
leaving the country or, if abroad, compelled to return.
- The  judge  may  prevent  a  person  from  entering  certain  premises  under
dispute or declared off-limits by the proper authorities.
- Health  officers  may  restrict  access  to  contaminated  areas  and  also
quarantine those already exposed to disease sought to be contained.

- Secretary of State may regulate or even prohibit the travel of citizens to
hostile  countries  to  prevent  possible  international  misunderstanding  and
conflict. (p 169 Cruz 2000 ed)

Return to one’s Country

In Marcos  vs  Manglapus (178  SCRA  660),  the  SC  sustained  the
refusal of the government to allow the petitioner’s return to the Philippines,
on the ground that it would endanger national security. The right to travel and
the liberty of abode are distinct from the right to return to one’s country, as
shown  by  the  fact  the  UDHR  and  the  Covenant  on  HR  have  separate
gurantees for these. Hence the right to return to one’s country is not covered
by  the  specific  right  to  travel  and  liberty  of  abode.  Consequently,  the
requirements  prescribed  in  Section  6  relative  to  the  right  to  travel  and  the
liberty of abode do not apply. (Implicitly the Court says that the right to return,
not being specifically guaranteed, must be treated simply under the general
rubric of liberty.)

The  Court  also  said  that  the  right  to  travel  guaranteed  in  the
Constitution involves the right to travel within the country, the right to leave
the  country, but not the right to retun to one’s country. It arrived at this
conclusion  from  the  fact  that  the  Universal  Declaration  of  HR  has  one
provision for the right to move within the country and out of the country and
another for the right to return to one’s country. Thus, whereas the UDHR is
normally used to affirm or supplement rights in domestic law, the Court chose
to use it to curtail the guarantee of our domestic law. (Bernas, *Thick book,
p. 379)



Rights granted are:
- The right to information on matters of public concern
- The corollary right of access to official record and documents (given as an
implementation of the right to information) . (p. 91 Bernas)

Access to information on matters of public concern is essential to the
proper exercise of freedom of expression. (Cruz 2000 ed p 246)

Take Note: These are POLITICAL RIGHTS available to citizens only.

## 10. RIGHT TO INFORMATION


Under RA  6713,  public  officials  and  employees  are mandated  to
provide   information   on   their   policies   and   procedures   in   clear   and
understandable  language,  and  ensure  openness  of  information,  public
consultations and hearings whenever appropriate”, except when otherwise
provided by law or when required by the public interest. In particular, the law
mandates   free   public   access,   at   reasonable   hours,   to   the   annual
performance reports of offices and agencies of GOCCs and the  statement
of  assets,  liabilities  and  financial  disclosures  of  all  public  officials  and
employees.
## Limitations
The people’s right to know is limited to matters of public concern and
is further subject to such limitation as may be provided by law. Similarly, the
policy  of  full  disclosure  is  confined  to  transactions  involving  public  interest
and is subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law.
The  terms  public  concerns  and  public  interest  have  eluded  precise
definition. But both terms embrace a broad spectrum of subjects which the
public may want to know, either because these directly affect their lives or
simply  because  such  matters  naturally  whet  the  interest  of  an  ordinary
citizen. At the end of the day, it is for the courts to determine, on a case to
case basis, whether or not an issue is of interest or importance to the public.
(BA-RA 7941 vs COMELEC GR 177271)
However, the following are recognized restrictions:
- National security matters and intelligence information
There   is   governmental   privilege   against   public   disclosure   with
respect  to  state  secrets  regarding  the  military,  diplomatic  and  other
national  security matters. But where there is no need to protect such state
secrets, the privilege may not be invoked to withhold documents and other
information,  provided  that  they  are  examined  in  strict  confidence  and
given scrupulous protection.
- Trade secrets and banking transactions – Ruling in Garcia vs Board
of Investments; See: Bank Secrecy Law
- Criminal matters
Also excluded are classified law enforcement matters, such as  those
relating to the apprehension, the prosecution and the detention of criminals,
which courts may not inquire into prior to such to such arrest, detention
and prosecution.
- Other confidential information
The   Ethical   Standards   Act   further   prohibits   public   officials   and
employees  from  using  or  divulging  confidential  or  classified  information

officially known to them by reason of their office and not made available to
the public.
These   include,   diplomatic   correspondence,   closed   door   Cabinet
meetings and executive sessions of either house of Congress, as well as the
internal deliberations of the Supreme Court. (p. 235 Duka)
- Privileged  information  rooted  in  separation  of  powers (p.  166
## Nachura)

In Legaspi vs CSC , it was held that while the manner of examining
public records may be subject to reasonable regulation by the government
agency  in  custody  thereof,  the  duty  to  disclose  the  information  of  public
concern, and to afford access to public records, cannot be discretionary on
the part of said agencies.

Publication of Laws and Regulations

Mysterious pronouncements and rumored rules cannot be recognized
as  binding  unless  their  existence  and  contents  are  confirmed  by  a  valid
publication  intended  to  make  full  disclosure  and    give  proper  notice  to  the
people. (Tanada vs Tuvera 146 SCRA 446)
See: EO 200 and Article 2 CC

Circulars  having  been  issued  for  the  implementation  of  the  law
authorizing its issuance has the force and effect of law, according to settled
jurisprudence. (US vs Tupas Molina 29 Phil 119. )
Circulars which are mere statements of general policy as to how the
law should be construed do not need presidential approval and publication.
(Victoria Milling Corp vs Social Security Commission L-16704.)

Rule on publication is applied to executive orders and admin rules the
same having the force of the law. (p. 16 De Leon 2002 ed.)

Access to Court Records

In Baldoza vs Dimaano (71 SCRA 14), the SC sustained the right of
a municipal mayor to examine judicial records , subject to reasonable rules
and  conditions.  Quoting  from Subido  vs  Ozaeta, (80  Phil  383),  the  Court
said “ Except perhaps when it is clear that the purpose of the examination is
unlawful or sheer, idle curiosity, we do not believe it is the duty under the law

of registration officers to concern themselves with the motives, reasons and
objects of the person seeking access to the records.
In Hilado vs Reyes, (GR 163155), where petitioners, who had filed an
action for damages against the decedent during its lifetime and whose claims
for   damages   were   included   in   the   inventory   of   the   liabilities   in   the
proceedings for the settlement of the estate, sought to see the court records
and obtain true copies of the inventory of the assets of the deceased but was
denied the probate court, the SC granted access to the information sought.
The Court held that unlike court orders and decisions, pleadings and other
documents filed by parties to a case need not be matters of public concern
or interest, and that access to public records may be restricted on a showing
of good cause.
In Lantaco  vs  Llamas, (108  SCRA  502), where  a  judge  gave
petitioners  a  run-around  in  obtaining  a  copy  of  a  court  decision,  the  Court
said: “While public officers in custody or control of public records have the
discretion to regulate the manner in which such records may be inspected,
examined or  copied  by  interested  persons,  such  discretion  does  not  carry
with it the authority to prohibit access, inspection, examination, or copying.

Right to Information Relative to Government Contract Negotiations

In the case of Chavez vs PEA, it was held that the constitutional right
to information includes official information on on-going negotiations before a
final contract.
The information, however, must constitute definite propositions by the
government  and  should  not  cover  recognized  exceptions  like  privileged
information,  military  and  diplomatic  secrets  and  similar  matters  affecting
national  security  and  public  order.  Information,  for  instance,  on  on-going
evaluation or review of bids or proposals being undertaken by the bidding or
review   committee   is   not   immediately   accessible   under   the   right   of
information.
While  the  evaluation  or  review  is  still  on-going, there are no “official
acts, transactions or decisions” on the bids or proposals. However, one the
committee   makes   it   official recommendation; there   arises   a   definite
proposition on the part of the government. From this moment, the public’s
right  to  information  attaches,  and  any  citizen  can  access  all  the  non-
proprietary  information  leading  to  such  proposition.      Congress  has  also
prescribed other limitations on the right to information in several legislations.
In Chavez vs PCGG, it was held that it is incumbent upon the PCGG,
and  its  officers,  as  well  as  other  government  representatives,  to  disclose

sufficient public information on any proposed settlement they have decided
to take up with the ostensible owners and holders of ill-gotten wealth. Such
information though must pertain to definite propositions of the government,
not   necessarily   to   intra-agency   or   inter-agency   recommendations   or
communications  during  the  stage  when  common  assertions  are  still  in  the
process of being formulated or are in the “exploratory stage”.
Right to Information Relative to Diplomatic Negotiations

In PMPF   v.   Manglapus,   the   therein   petitioners   were   seeking
information from the President’s representatives on the state of the then on-
going negotiations of the RP-US Military Bases Agreement.
The Court denied the petition, stressing that “secrecy of negotiations
with  foreign  countries  is  not  violative of the  constitutional  provisions  of
freedom  of  speech  or  of  the  press  nor of  the  freedom  of  access  to
information.”  The Resolution went on to state, thus:
The  nature  of  diplomacy  requires  centralization  of  authority  and
expedition  of  decision  which  are  inherent  in  executive  action.    Another
essential characteristic of diplomacy is its confidential nature.
In Akbayan  vs  Aquino,  it  was  held  that The  privileged  character  of
diplomatic   negotiations   has   been   recognized   in   this   jurisdiction.      In
discussing valid limitations on the right to information, the Court in Chavez
v. PCGG held that “information on inter-government exchanges prior to the
conclusion   of   treaties   and   executive   agreements   may   be   subject   to
reasonable safeguards for the sake of national interest.
Applying the principles adopted in PMPF v. Manglapus, it is clear that
while the final text of the JPEPA may not be kept perpetually confidential –
since there should be “ample opportunity for discussion before [a treaty] is
approved” – the  offers  exchanged  by  the  parties  during  the  negotiations
continue to be privileged even after the JPEPA is published.  It is reasonable
to conclude that the Japanese representatives submitted their offers with the
understanding  that  “historic   confidentiality”  would  govern   the   same.
Disclosing these offers could impair the ability of the Philippines to deal not
only with Japan but with other foreign governments in future negotiations.




Meaning  of  the  provision: All  it  means  is  that  the  right  to  form
associations shall not be impaired without due process of law. It includes the
right not to join. (p. 97 Bernas)
## 11. RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION
## O


Scope: The right to form, or join, unions or associations, includes the
right  not  to  join  or,  if  one  is  already  a  member,  to  disaffiliate  from  the
association. (p. 169 Nachura).

Right not absolute however.

- In Occena vs COMELEC, it was held that the right was not violated when
political parties were prohibited from participating the barangay elections in
order to insure the partisanship of political candidates; political neutrality is
needed to discharge the duties of barangay officials.

- In Victoriano    vs  Elialde  Rope,  SC  upheld the  validity  of  RA  3350,
allowing  workers  to  dissociate  from  or  not  to  join  a  labor  union  despite  a
closed  shop  agreement,  if  they  are  members  of  any  religious  sect  which
prohibits such affiliation.

- Art 245 of the Labor Code.
- Compulsory membership of lawyers in the IBP held in In Re: Edillon.
## 5. Anti Subversion Act

The  right  to  unionize  or  to  form  organizations  is  now  explicitly
recognized and granted to employees in both governmental and the private.
Art III; Article XIII, Sec 3 Constitution.

As  to  strike,  involving  government  employees,  one  has  to  determine
whether the government corporation was established under the Corporation
Code or an original charter.

In the absence of a statute, public employees do not have the right to
engage in concerted work stoppages for any purpose. (GSIS vs KMG GR

Government   employees  may,   therefore,   through   their   unions   or
associations, either petition the Congress for the betterment of the terms and
conditions  of  employment  which  are  within  the  ambit  of  legislation  or
negotiate with the appropriate government agencies for the improvement of
those which are not fixed by law. If there be any unresolved grievances, the
dispute  may  be  referred  to  the  Public  Sector  Labor—Mgt  Council  for
appropriate action. (SSSEA vs CA GR 85279)

As to interest:

fixed  by  the  court, the  amount shall  earn  interest  at the  legal  rate  until full
payment is effected.
NAPOCOR vs Angas  (208 SCRA 542) held that interest must be fixed
at 6% pa as prescribed by Art 2209 CC as the kind of interest here is by way
of damages.

Title to property

Title does not pass until after payment of JC. Thus, the owner of land
subject to expropriation may still dispose of the same before payment of JC.

or abandoned, the property shall revert to the former owner then the former
owner can reacquire the property. (MCIAA vs CA GR 139495)

e) Miscellaneous Application




As  to  intrusions  by  private  persons  into  contractual  obligations,  the
Court  has  said  that  this is  governed  by  statutory  enactments  not  by  the
impairment clause of the Constitution. The sole purpose of this provision is
to   safeguard   the   integrity   of   valid   contractual   agreements   against
unwarranted interference by the State in the form of laws. (New Sampaguita
vs PNB 435 SCRA 565)

We all know that contracts must yield to the State’s exercise of power.
However, one has to know whether the State’s exercise of PP is valid.

Contemporary Application of the Contract Clause

In  the  case  of CBC  vs  ADB (GR  172192),  it  was  held  that  the  non-
impairment clause is a limit on the exercise of legislative power and not of
judicial or quasi-judicial power.

Considerations which prevail over contracts: Demands of police power
prevail over contracts. (p. 498 Suarez). However, some books also say that
eminent domain and the State’s power of taxation also does.




The  right  to  litigate  is  an  escape  valve  to  relieve  the  pressures  of
personal   disagreements   that   might   otherwise   explode   into   physical
confrontation. (Que vs CA 169 SCRA 137)

While authorities are not required to relieve the accused of his poverty,
they have   the  obligation   not  to  take   advantage   of  indigence  in   the
administration of justice. (Miranda vs Arizona 384 US 436.)
Even  in  case,  xxx,  where  the  accused  had  signified  his  intent  to
withdraw his appeal, the court is required to inquire into the reason for the

## 14.  LEGAL  ASSISTANCE  AND  FREE  ACCESS  TO
## COURTS


withdrawal. Where it finds the sole reason for the withdrawal to be poverty,
as in this case, the court must assign a counsel de officio, for despite such
withdrawal, the duty to protect the rights of the accused subsists and perhaps
with greater reason. (People vs Rio 201 SCRA 702)

Indigent party – 1997 Rules of CivPro Sec 21 Rule 3. Indigence include an
exemption from payment of docket and other lawful fees and of transcripts
of steno notes which the court may order to be furnished him. The amount
of the docket and other lawful fees which the indigent was exempted from
paying shall be a lien on any judgment rendered in the case favorable to the
indigent, unless the court otherwise provides. (Duka p. 257)

Read RA 9406 – PAO

It must be pointed out that not simply because there is a guarantee of
free  access  to  the  courts  that  Philippine  Courts  could  and  should  always
assume jurisdiction over cases brought by its citizens.
It  was    held  in Santos  III  vs  Northwest (210  SCRA  256),  the
constitutional  guaranty  of  access  to  courts  refers  only  to  courts  with
appropriate jurisdiction as defined by law. It does not mean that a person can
go to any court for redress of his grievances regardless of the nature or value
of his claim.



## Availability

The  Miranda  doctrine  embodied  in  Sec  12  Art  III  are  available  only
during custodial investigation or in-custody interrogation of accused persons.
(People vs Judge Ayson 175 SCRA 216.)

Custodial Investigation has been defined as any questioning initiated
by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or
otherwise  deprived  of  his  freedom  of  action  in  a  significant  way.  The  rule
begins to operate as soon as the investigation ceases to be a general inquiry
into an unsolved crime, and direction is then aimed upon a particular suspect
who has been taken into custody and to whom the police would then direct
interrogatory questions which tend to elicit incriminating statements. (People
vs De la Cruz GR 118866-68)

## 15. RIGHTS OF SUSPECTS


The guarantee does not apply :
- To  spontaneous  statement,  not  elicited  through  questioning  by  the
authorities  but  given  in  an  ordinary  manner  whereby  the  suspect  orally
admitted having committed the offense;
- Admissions or confessions made by a suspect before he was placed under
custodial investigation.;
- A  police  line-up  is  not  considered  a  part  of  custodial  inquest.  However,
when a police line-up or a show-up was made during custodial investigation,
any identification of an uncounselled accused made in a police line-up or in
a show-up AFTER the start of the custodial investigation is inadmissible in
evidence against him. (People vs Escordial)
- Normal audit investigations
- Investigation conducted by the employer.
- Investigation conducted by the CSC.
- Counter-affidavit   submitted   by   the   respondent   during   preliminary
investigation  is  admissible  in evidence,  because  PI  is not  part  of custodial
investigation . (p. 175 Nachura)
- Booking  sheet  and  arrest report,  the  same  not  being  admission  or
confession of any incriminating circumstance.
- Photograph or paraffin test as he is not yet under custodial investigation..


Read RA 7438 which states that custodial investigation shall include the
practice of issuing an invitation to a person who is investigated in connection
with an offense he is suspected to have committed, without prejudice to the
liability of the inviting officer for any violation of the law.

Rights available:
a) To remain silent
b) To competent and independent counsel c)To be informed of such
right

## Requisites

Right to Remain Silent
If the suspect refuses to give a statement, no adverse inference shall
be made from his refusal to answer questions

Right to Competent and Independent Counsel


When available – at all stages of the investigation (People vs Hassan 157
## SCRA 261)

It is not enough that that the subject is informed of such right; he should
also be asked if he wants to avail of the same and should be told that he can
ask for counsel if he so desires or that one will be provided him at his request.
(People vs Agustin 240 SCRA 541)

## Competent
Includes  being  effective  and vigilant. He must  ne  one  devoted to his
client’s cause in a manner that really protects him and not one who throws
in  only  a  lackadaistical  effort.  His  assistance  must  be  continuous,  from
beginning to end. (People vs Rodriguez 341 SCRA 645).
Thus,  the  lawyer  must  be  present  at  all  stages  of  the  interview,
counseling or advising caution reasonably at every turn of the investigation,
and  stopping  the  interrogation  once  in  a  while  either  to  give  advice  to  the
accused that  he may  either  continue, choose  to  remain  silent  or terminate
the interview.  What is required is meaningful advocacy of the rights of the
person undergoing questioning. (People vs Velarde 348 SCRA 646)

Independent Counsel of Choice

The  counsel  must  be  one  whose  interests  do  not  run  counter  to  the
intended representation. He should not be serving two masters at the same
time. (People vs Barasina 229 SCRA 450)

The right to counsel does not mean that the accused must personally
hire  his own  counsel.  The  constitutional  requirement  is  satisfied  when  a
counsel  is  engaged  by  anyone  acting  on  behalf  of  the  person  under
investigation, or appointed by the court upon petition by said person or by
someone on his behalf. (People vs Espiritu GR 128287)

However, the rule is not intended as a deterrent to the accused from
confession of guilt if he voluntarily and intelligently so desires but to protect
the accused from admitting what he is coerced to admit although untrue.  The
presence of a lawyer is not intended to stop an accused from saying anything
which might incriminate him, but rather, it was adopted in our Constitution to
preclude  the  slightest  coercion  as  would  lead  the  accused  to  admit
something false.  The counsel, however, should never prevent an accused

from  freely  and  voluntarily  telling  the  truth.   (People  v.  Base,  G.R.  No.
## 109773)

While the  initial choice  of the  lawyer  in  cases where  a  person  under
custodial  investigation  cannot  afford  the  services  of  a  lawyer  is  naturally
lodged in the police investigators, the accused really has the final choice as
he may reject the counsel chosen for him and ask for another one.  A lawyer
provided by the investigators is deemed engaged by the accused where he
never  raised  any  objection  against  the  former’s  appointment  during  the
course  of  the  investigation  and  the  accused  thereafter  subscribes  to the
veracity of his statement before the swearing officer.  (People v. Gallardo,
et al., G.R. No. 113684)

The Supreme Court said that the right to counsel still applies in certain
pre-trial  proceedings  that  are  considered  critical  stages  in  the  criminal
process. Custodial interrogation before or after charges has been filed, and
non-custodial interrogation after the accused has been formally charged, are
considered  critical  pre-trial  stages  in  the  criminal  process. (People  vs
Espanola GR 119308)

To be informed of such rights

This  contemplates  the  transmission  of  meaningful  information  rather
than   just   the   ceremonial   and   perfunctory   recitation   of   an   abstract
constitutional principle. (People vs Nicandro. 141 SCRA 289)

## Waiver

## 2 Kinds

a) Waiver at the moment of giving incriminating statements
Sec 2d of RA 7438 provides that any extrajudicial confession made by
a  person  arrested,  detained,  or  under  custodial  investigation  shall  be  in
writing and signed by such person in the presence of his counsel or in the
latter's absence, upon a valid waiver, and in the presence of any of the
parents,  older  brothers  and  sisters,  his  spouse,  the  municipal  mayor,  the
municipal judge, district school supervisor, or priest or minister of the gospel
as   chosen   by   him;   otherwise   such   extrajudicial   confession   shall   be
inadmissible as evidence in any proceeding.


b)   Waiver   with   regard   to   the   admissibility   during   trial   of   an
uncounselled or coerced extrajudicial confession
If  no  timely  objection  is  made  to  the  introduction  of such  tainted
confessions or admissions, the same would be admissible on the ground that
the accused had waived his right not to have the same be considered as part
of the evidence against him. (People vs Samus 389 SCRA 93)




a) Criminal Due Process
## Requisites:
- Accused has been heard in a court of competent jurisdiction
- The accused is proceeded against under the orderly processes of law
- Accused was given notice and the opportunity to be heard
- Judgment rendered was within the authority of a  constitutional law.

Compared to Section 1 of Article III: Section 1 speaks of due process
in general, both in its substantive and procedural aspects. Section 14 refers
to  the  procedural  component  only.  It catalogues  the  essentials  of  due
process in a criminal prosecution.

Right to PI : Although of statutory origin only, its denial when the law
provides for it is a denieal of criminal due process. Right to PI is not mere
formal or technical right but is a substantive right. (Go vs CA 206 SCRA 138)

In order to disqualify a judge on the ground of bias and prejudice, the
movant must prove such bias by clear and convincing evidence. (Webb vs
People GR 127262).

But   where   questions   propounded   by   the   court   are   merely   for
clarification,  to  clear  up  dubious  points  and  elicit  relevant  evidence,  such
questioning will not constitute bias. (People vs Castillo 289 SCRA 213).

The  State,  and  more  so,  the  offended  party  is  also  entitled  to  due
process of law. (p, 199 Nachura)

For the purpose of satisfying the due process requirements, it is also
necessary that the accused have an understanding of what the proceeding
is all about. Accordingly, he would have to be assisted and informed in such
## 16. RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED


a language and in a manner that he can understand and comprehend what
is  being  conveyed.  This  means  that  he  has  to  be  given,  for  instance,  a
counsel  with  whom  he  could  communicate  and  qualified  and  competent
interpreter to assist him. (People vs Cuizon 256 SCRA 325)

b) Bail
Bail is the security given for the release of a person in custody oof the
law,  furnished  by  him  or  a  bondsman,  conditioned  upon  his  appearance
before any court as may be required. (Rule 114 Sec 1 ROC)

Origin – This emanates from the right to be presumed innocent

Who  is  entitled? Any  person  under  detention,  even  if  no  formal
charges have yet been filed.
Where to file
a)  Bail in the amount fixed may be filed with

1)    the  court  where  the  case  is  pending,  or  in  the  absence  of
unavailability of the judge thereof, with
2)    any  regional  trial  judge,  metropolitan  trial  judge,  municipal  trial
judge, or municipal circuit trial judge in the province, city, or municipality.
3)  If the accused is arrested in a province, city, or municipality, other
than where the case is pending, bail may be filed with any regional trial court
of said place, or, if no judge thereof is available, with any metropolitan trial
judge, municipal trial judged or municipal circuit trial judge thereto.
b)   Whenever the grant of bail is a matter of discretion, or the accused
seeks to be released on recognizance, the application can only be filed in

1)    the  court  where  the  case  is  pending,  whether  on  preliminary
investigation, trial, or appeal.

c)  Any person who is in custody who is not yet charged in court may
apply for bail with
1)  any court in the province, city or municipality where he is held.  Sec.
17, Rule 114, ROC

A person who appealed his conviction of homicide on a murder charge
to the Court of Appeals, may be denied bail by the Court of Appeals because
he could be convicted of a capital offense.  (Obosa v. Court of Appeals 266
## SCRA 281)


Duties of the trial judge where an application for bail is filed:
a.  give reasonable notice to the prosecutor or require him to submit
his recommendation. (Sec. 18, Rule 114, ROC)
b.  Conduct a hearing of the application for bail regardless of whether
or not the prosecution refuses to present evidence to show that the guilt of
the  accused  is  strong  for  the  purpose  of  enabling  the  court  to  exercise  its
sound discretion (Secs. 7 and 8)
c.  Decide whether the evidence of guilt of the accused is strong based
on the summary of evidence of the prosecution.
d.  If the guilt of the accused is not strong, discharge the accused upon
the approval of the bailbond.  (Sec. 19;  Basco v. Judge Rapatalo; A.M.
No. RTJ-96-1335)

Duties   of   the   Court   when   accused   is   charged   with   an   offense
punishable by RP or higher:

- A  hearing  on  the  motion  for  bail  must  be  conducted  by  the  judge  to
determine whether or not the evidence of guilt is strong
- Prosecution must be given an opportunity to present all evidence that
it may wish to introduce on the probable guilt of the accused before the
court resolves the motion for bail.
- Even  if  the  prosecution  refuses  to  adduce  evidence,  or  fails  to
interpose an objection to the motion for bail, it is still mandatory for the
court to conduct a hearing, or ask searching and clarificatory questions
from which it may infer the strength of the evidence of guilt, or lack of
it, against the accused. (Baylon vs Judge Sison 243 SCRA 284)

Hearing is mandatory when accused is charged with an offense
punishable  by  death,  reclusion  perpetua,  or  life  imprisonment.  The
judge shall conduct  a hearing whether  summary  or otherwise , not  only  to
take into account the guidelines set forth under the Rules for the grant of bail,
but primarily to determine the existence of strong evidence of guilt or the lack
of it, against the accused, only for purposes of bail.  If the evidence of guilt
is  not  strong,  bail  becomes  a  matter  of  right.   (People  v.  Hapa,  G.R.  No.
## 125698)

Due process to be given to prosecution in application for bail.  A bail
application does not only involve the right of the accused to temporary liberty,
but likewise the right of the State to protect the people and the peace of the

community  from  dangerous  elements.    “To  appreciate  the  strength  or
weakness  of  the  evidence  of  guilt,  the  prosecution must  be  consulted  or
heard.  It is equally entitled as the accused to due process.”  The prosecution
must be given ample opportunity to show that the evidence of guilt is strong.
(People v. Hon. Antona, etc., et al., G.R. No. 137681)

Rationale for giving due process to prosecution in bail applications.  By
the  very  nature  of  deciding  applications  for  bail,  it  based  on  evidence
presented   by   the   prosecution   that   judicial   discretion   is   exercised   in
determining whether the evidence of guilt of the accused is strong.

The determination of whether the evidence of guilt is strong is a matter
of judicial discretion.  Though not absolute nor beyond control, the discretion
of  the  trial  court  must  be  sound,  and  exercised  within  reasonable  bounds.
Discretion  must  be  exercised  regularly,  legally  and  within  the  confines  of
procedural  due  process,  that  is,  after  the  evaluation  of  the  evidence
submitted by the prosecution and the accused.

Any  order  issued  in  the  absence  thereof  is  not  a  product  of  sound
judicial discretion  but  of  whim  and  caprice  and  outright  arbitrariness.
(People v. Hon. Antona, etc., et al., G.R. No. 137681)

The  evidence  presented  during  the  bail  hearing  shall  be  considered
automatically  reproduced  at  the  trial,  but  upon  motion  of  either  party,  the
court may recall any witness for additional examination unless the latter is
dead, outside of the Philippines or otherwise unable to testify.  (Sec. 8, Rule
## 114, ROC)
Exceptions to the right to bail

When  charged  with  an  offense  punishable  by  RP  (or  higher)  and
evidence of guilt is strong.

Where the accused is charged with an offense punishable by RP, it is
the duty of the judge to determine if evidence of guilt is strong for purposes
of deciding whether bail may be granted or not. (Carpio vs Maglalang 196
## SCRA 41)

## Rules:

Before or after conviction in the MTC, MTCC – Right to bail is absolute


RTC – Before conviction (other than RP) – Right to bail is absolute

After  conviction  (other  than  RP) – Entitlement  to  bail  is  discretionary  w/
## Courts.

Charge  of  RP – Determine  existence  of  strong  evidence  of  guilt (p.  192
## Nachura)

Conviction of RP – Denied

Take Note: Traditionally, the right to bail is not available to the military

Arula vs Espino (28 SCRA 540) held that the right to speedy trial is
given  more  emphasis  in  the  military  where  the  right  to  bail  does  not  exist.
The  denial  of  the  right  to  bail  to  the  military  does  not  violate  the  equal
protection  clause  because  there  is  substantial  distinction  between  the
military and civilians.

c) Presumption of Innocence
May be invoked only by an individual accused of a criminal offense; a
corporate entity has no personality to invoke the same. (Feeder vs CA 197
## SCRA 842)

Presumption that official duty was regularly performed cannot by itself,
prevail over the constitutional presumption of innocence. (People vs Martos
## 211 SCRA 805)
But  where  it  is  not  the  sole  basis  for  conviction,  the  presumption  of
regularity   of   performance   of   official   functions   may   prevail   over   the
constitutional  presumption  of  innocence. (People  vs  Acuram  209  SCRA
## 281)

The constitutional presumption will not apply as long as there is some
logical connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed,
and  the inference  of  one  fact  from  proof  of  another  shall  not  be  so
unreasonable as to be a purely arbitrary mandate. (People vs Burton 268
## SCRA 531)
The   constitutional   presumption   may   be   overcome   by   contrary
presumptions   based   on   the   experience   of   human   conduct,   such   as
unexplained flight which may lead to an inference of guilt. (p. 200 Nachura)


In order that circumstantial evidence may warrant conviction the
following requisites must be present:
- there is more than 1 circumstance
- the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven
- the  combination  of  all  the  circumstances  is  such  as  to  produce  a
conviction beyond reasonable doubt. (People vs Bato GR 113804)

Equipose Rule – Applies when the evidence is so evenly balanced in which
case  the  constitutional  presumption  of  innocence  should  tilt  the  scales  in
favor of the accused. (Corpus vs People 194 SCRA 73).

d) Right to be Heard

Elements of the general right to be heard:
- the right to be present at the trial
- the right to counsel
- the right to an impartial judge
- right of confrontation
- the  right  to  compulsory  process  to  secure  the  attendance  of  the
witness. (Bernas p 150)

Scope of the right to be present at the trial

Covers only the period from arraignment to promulgation of sentence
(US vs Beecham 23 Phil 259.)
However, this has been modified by Sec 14(2) which says that “after
arraignment, trial may proceed notwithstanding the absence of the accused
provided  that  he  has  been  duly  notified  and  his  failure  to  appear  is
unjustifiable

Conditions for waiver of the right to be present at the trial
The  right  may  be  waived  provided  that  after  arraignment  he  may  be
COMPELLED to appear for purpose of identification by the witnesses of the
prosecution  OR  provided  he  unqualifiedly  admits  in  open  court  after  his
arraignment  that  he  is  the  person  named  as  the  defendant  in  the  case  on
trial. Reason for requiring the presence of the accused, despite his waiver,
is, if allowed to be absent in all the stages of the proceeding without giving
the People’s witnesses the opportunity to identify him in court, he may in his
defense  say  that  he  was  never  identified  as  the  person  charged  in  the

information  and,  therefore,  is  entitled  to  acquittal. (People  vs  Presiding
Judge GR L-64731)

Requisites of a valid trial in absentia
- accused has been arraigned
- he has been duly notified of the trial
- his failure to appear is unjustifiable

e) Assistance of Counsel

The right guaranteed by the Constitution is to an EFFECTIVE counsel,
not necessarily an INTELLIGENT one. (People vs Liwanag 363 SCRA 62)

Duty imposed on the judge by the guaranty
If the defendant appears without counsel he must be informed by the
court that he has a right to have a counsel before being arraigned, and must
be  asked  if he  desires the  aid  of  a counsel. If he  desires  and  is  unable to
employ counsel, the court must assign counsel to defend him. This is a right
which  the  defendant  should  not  be  deprived  of,  and  failure  of  the  court  to
assign counsel or, after counsel has been assigned, require him to perform
this duty by appearing and defending the accused would be sufficient cause
for the reversal of the case. (US vs Gimeno 1 Phil 236)

Pre-arraignment duties of the Judge
See 4-fold duty under Rule 116 Sec 6 of the ROC.
In criminal cases, there can be no fair hearing unless the accused be
given an opportunity to be heard by counsel. The right to be heard would be
of little avail if it does not include the right to be heard by counsel. (People
vs Holgado 85 Phil 752)

It is also elementary that the accused himself has the primary right to
choose his own counsel. However, considering the State’s and the offended
party’s right to speedy and adequate justice, the court may restrict his option
to  retain  a  orivate counsel  if the  accused  insists  on  an  attorney  he cannot
afford, or if the chosen counsel is not a member of the Bar, or if the attorney
declines to represent the accused for a valid reason. (People vs Rivera 362
## SCRA 153)

The  counsel  of  course  must  be  a  lawyer,  though  this  may  be
subsequently waived provided it is done with the assistance of a bona fide

lawyer. People vs Tulin 364 SCRA 10. In the case of Sayson vs People 166
SCRA 680, it was held that this right can as well be waived such as when an
accused repeatedly fails to show up with his counsel de parte without any
justifiable reason. Likewise, he may not insist on having a counsel de officio
appointed for him throughout the trial if by his actions he is deemed to have
waived the same since the right to have counsel appointed for him is only
## MANDATORY DURING THE ARRAIGNMENT.

The  preference  in  the  choice  of  counsel  pertains  more  aptly  and
specifically to a person UNDER INVESTIGATION rather than one who is the
accused  in  criminal  prosecution. (Amion  vs  Judge  Chiongson; AM  NO.
## RTJ-97-1371)


f) Right to be Informed

## Objectives:
To furnish the accused with such a description of the charge against
him as will enable him to make his defense.
To  avail  himself of his conviction  or acquittal  for  protection  against  a
further prosecution for the same cause
To inform the court of the facts alleged, so that it may decide whether
they  are  sufficient  in  law  to  support  a  conviction,  if  one  is  had. (US  vs
Cruikshank 92 US 542)

Requisites: The information must state -
-  name of the accused
- the designation given by the offense by statute
- statement of the acts or omissions so complained of as constituting
the offense
-  name of the offended party
- approximate time and date of the commission
- place where the offense had been committed

The process  of  informing  is  basically  done  through  arraignment
whereby  the  accused  is  apprised  of  the  charge  against  him,  including  the
acts or omissions he is supposed to have done or failed to do. In this regard,
the  requirement  that  the  Information  should  be  read  to  the  accused  in  a
language  or  dialect  known  to  him  is  mandatory  and  that  it  must  be  strictly
complied  with  as  it  is  intended  to  protect  the  constitutional  right  to  be

informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, a part of due
process. (People vs Ong 432 SCRA 470).
In short, the complaint must contain a specific allegation of every fact
and  circumstance  necessary  to  constitute  the  crime  charged..  Since,  an
accused  cannot  be  convicted  of  a  crime  for  which  he  was  not  charged  .
(Pecho vs People 262 SCRA 518)

In order that this requirement may be satisfied, facts must be stated;
not conclusions of law. (Pecho vs People GR 111399)

Right  to  be  informed  of the nature  and  cause  of the  accusation may
not be waived. Indeed, the defense may waive their right to enter a plea and
let the court enter a plea of not guilty in their behalf. However, it becomes
altogether a different matter if the accused themselves refuse to be informed
of the nature and cause of the accusation against them. The defense cannot
hold  hostage  the  court  by  their  refusal  to  the  reading  of  the  complaint  or
information. (People vs Dy GR 115236-37)

Variance doctrine – In spite of the difference between the crime that
was charged and that which was eventually proved, the accused still may be
convicted of whatever offense that was proved even if not specifically set out
in the Information provided it was included in what was charged. (Teves vs
Sandiganbayan 447 SCRA 309)

Right to be informed vis-a-vis aggravating circumstances

Under the law, it is now required that AC, whether generic or qualifying,
must be alleged in the Information or Complaint in order to be appreciated.
(People vs Buada 391 SCRA 251).

This has not always been the rule, however, as it was then held that
aggravating and qualifying circumstances whch were not alleged but proved
during trial may be appreciated as generic AC for purposes of imposing the
proper penalty. (People vs Ramos 296 SCRA 559.)

## Waiver:
The  right  to  be  informed  of  the  nature  and  cause  of  the  accusation
against him may not be waived, but the defense may waive the right to enter
a  plea  and  let  the  court  enter  a  plea  of  not  guilty. (People  vs  Bryan  GR
## 115236-37)


Failure  to  object  to  the  multiple  offenses  alleged  in  the  criminal
information during the arraignment is deemed a waiver of the right. (Abalos
vs People GR 136994)

An information which lacks certain material allegations may still sustain
a conviction when the accused fails to object to its sufficiency during the trial,
and  the  deficiency  is  cured  by  competent  evidence  presented  therein.
(People vs Palarca GR 146020

g) Right to Speedy and Impartial Trial
Speedy trial – a trial free from vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays.
But  justice  and  fairness,  not  speed,  are  the  objectives. (Acevedo  vs
Sarmiento 36 SCRA 247)

The   right   is   relative;   what   offends   the   right   are   unjustified
postponements  which  prolong  trial  for  an  unreasonable  length  of  time.
(People vs Tampal 244 SCRA 202)

Further,  even  as  the  right  to  a  speedy  trial  is  guaranteed  to  the
accused, the same should not be utilized to deprive the State of a reasonable
opportunity  of  fairly  indicting  and  prosecuting  criminals. (Domingo  vs
Sandiganbayan 322 SCRA 655)

Where    a    prosecuting    officer,    without    good    cause,    secures
postponements  of  the  trial  of  a  defendant  against  his  protest  beyond  a
reasonable  period  of  time,  as  in  this  instance  for  more  than  a  year,  the
accused  is  entitled  to  relief  by  a  proceeding  in  mandamus  to  compel  a
dismissal of the information, or if he be restrained of his liberty, by habeas
corpus to obtain his freedom. (Conde vs Rivera 45 Phil 650)

Right to prompt disposition and judgment – covered by Sec 16 Art III of
the  Constitution.  This  provision  is  also  relative.  What  the  Constitution
prohibits  are  unreasonable,  arbitrary  and  oppressive  delays  which  render
rights nugatory. In the determination of whether or not the right to a speedy
trial  has  been  violated,  certain  factors  may  be  considered  and  balanced
against each other. These are length of delay, reason for the delay, assertion
if  the  right  or  failure  to  assert  it  and  prejudice  caused  by  the  delay.  Same
factors may as well be considered in “speedy disposition. (Guerrero vs CA
## 257 SCRA 703)


While  this  Court  recognizes  the  right  to  speedy  disposition  quite
distinctly from the right to a speedy trial, and although this Court has always
zealously espoused the protection from oppressive and vexatious delays not
attributable to the party involved, at the same time, we hold that a party’s
individual rights should not wok against and preclude the people’s equally
important right to public justice. (Guerrero vs CA 257 SCRA 703)
Read  Speedy Trial Act of 1998

In determining the right of an accused to speedy trial, courts should do
more than a mathematical computation of the number of postponements of
the scheduled hearings of the case.
The right to a speedy trial is deemed violated when:
- the proceedings are attended by VCO delays
- when unjustified postponements are asked and secured
- when without cause or justifiable motive a long period of time is allowed
to elapse without the party having his case tried.

In  the  absence  of  a  showing  that  delays  were  unreasonable  and
capricious, the State should not be deprived of a reasonable opportunity of
prosecuting an accused. (People vs Tee 395 SCRA 419)

Take  Note: Dismissal  based  on  right  to  speedy  trial  amounts  to  an
acquittal. (Marcos vs Sandiganbayan 297 SCRA 95)

## Impartial Trial
Accused  is  entitled  to  the  cold  neutrality  of  an  impartial  judge  .
(Nachura p. 208). But the impartiality of the judge cannot be assailed on the
ground  that  he  propounded  clarificatory  (not  adversarial; e.g.  cross-
examination questions) questions to the accused. (People vs Castillo GR
## 120282).

And not only must he be impartial. He must appear to be so also, for
perceptions could go a long way in crediting the credibility of his dispositions.
(People vs Zheng Bai Hui 338 SCRA 420)

A trial judge should not participate in the examination of witnesses as
to create the impression that he is allied with the prosecution.


xxx Examination of witnesses is the more appropriate function of the
counsel, and the instances are rare and the conditions exceptional which will
justify  the  presiding  judge  in  conducting  an  extensive  examination.  It  is
always embarrassing for counsel to object to what he may deem improper
questions by the court. (Tabuena vs Sandiganbayan 268 SCRA 332)

Pervasive publicity is not per se prejudicial to the right of the accused
to a fair trial. (Garcia vs Domingo 52 SCRA 143) There must be allegation
and proof that the judges have been unduly influenced, not simply that they
might be, by the barrage of publicity. (Martelino vs Alejandro)

## Public Trial

Purpose  is  to  safeguard  the  proceedings  against  any  attempts  to
employ our courts as instruments of persecution. The knowledge that every
criminal  trial  is  subject  to  contemporaneous  review  in  the  forum  of  public
opinion  is  an  effective  restraint  on  possible  abuse  of  judicial  power. (In  re
Oliver 333 US 270)

A public trial is not synonymous with publicized trial; it only implies that
the court doors must be open to those who wish to come, sit in the available
seats, conduct themselves with decorum and observe the trial process. (AM
No 01-4-03-SC).

This does not preclude the courts from excluding the public, however,
where the subject matter is sensitive or otherwise dictated by the nature of
the  proceedings,  as  in  rape  cases  where  the  audience  might  be  more
interested as salacious voyeurs that disinterested spectators. (Rule 119 Sec
## 21 ROC )

h) Right of Confrontation

Right  means  the  OPPORTUNITY  to  confront  whoever  it  is  whose
testimony  or  evidence  may  lead  the  former  to  lose  his  liberty  or  even  life.
Thus,  the  right  to cross-examine may be waived. (Gorospe Volume  2  p.
## 486)

Purpose – Aside  from  discovery  of  the  truth, the  right  of  cross-
examination  also  has  the  added  purpose  of  allowing  the  judge  to  observe

the deportment of the witness on the stand and thereby assist him in forming
his conclusions. (Gorospe Volume 2  p. 487)
Principal exceptions to the right of confrontation:
- Admissibility of dying declarations
- Trial in absentia under Section 14(2) (Bernas p. 162)
- The right is available during trial which begins only upon arraignment
(PI not included). (Dequito vs Arellano 81 Phil 128)

The  testimony  of  a  witness  who  has  not  been  submitted  himself  to
cross-examination is not admissible in evidence. Affidavits of witnesses, who
are  not  presented  during  trial  and  thus,  are  not  subjected  to  cross,  are
inadmissible being hearsay. (People vs Quidato GR 117401)

Lack  of  cross-examination  due  to  the  death  of  the  witness  does  not
necessarily render the deceased’s previous  testimony  expungible.  Where
death   prevents   cross-examination   under   such   circumstances   that   no
responsibility  of  any  sort  can  be  ascribed  to  the  plaintiff  or  the  witness,  it
seems  a  harsh  measure  to  strike  out  all  that  has  obtained  in  the  direct
examination. (People vs Narca 275 SCRA 696)
Mere opportunity not actual cross is necessary. However in the case
of People vs Seneris (99 SRA 92), it was held that the failure to complete
the  cross-examination  was  the  fault  neither  of  the  defense  nor  of  the
prosecution; not of the defense, because he did proceed with the cross to
the extent that there was time; not to the prosecution, because it was not the
state’s fault that the witness should die. In such a situation, the rule is that
so much of the testimony as has already been covered by cross should be
admissible in evidence.

Take Note: Rule 115 Section 1 of the ROC and Rule 130 Sec 47 of the
ROC.  Exceptions  found  in  Sec  46  Rule  130  must  be  strictly  construed
because of the Bill of Rights provision. (Toledo Jr vs Judge Kapunan L-
## 36603).

i) Compulsory Process

The right assures the accused an opportunity to compel the production
of evidence and the attendance of witnesses on his behalf in order that he
may be adequately equipped to present his side.


Subpoena – is a process directed to a person requiring him to attend
and  to  testify  at  the  hearing  or  trial  of  an  action  or  at  any  investigation
conducted  under  the  laws  of  the  Philippines,  or  for  the  taking  of  his
deposition. (Caamic vs Galapon 237 SCRA 390)
Subpoena ad testificandum – to compel a person to testify
Subpoena duces tecum – used to compel the production of books,
records, things or documents therein specified.

Requisites for SDT to issue:
- must   appear   prima   facie   relevant   to   the   issue   subject   of   the
controversy
- such books must be reasonably described by the parties to be readily
identified (Roco vs Contreras GR 158275)

Requisites   for   compelling   the   attendance   of   witnesses   and   the
production of evidence:
- evidence is really material
- accused is not guilty of neglect in previously obtaining the production
of such evidence
- the evidence will be available at the time desired
- no  similar  evidence  may  be  obtained. (People  vs  Chua  356  SCRA
## 225)

Webb vs De Leon

To start with, our Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly provide
for  discovery  proceedings  during  the  preliminary  investigation  stage  of  a
criminal proceeding. Sections 10 and 11 of Rule 117 do provide an accused
the right to move for a bill of particulars and for production or inspection of
material  evidence  in  possession  of  the  prosecution.  But  these  provisions
apply AFTER the filing of the complaint or information in court and the rights
are  accorded  to  the  accused  to  assist  them  to  make  an  intelligent  plea  at
arraignment and to prepare for trial.

THIS FAILURE  to  provide  discovery  procedure  during  PI  does  not,
however, negate its use by a person under investigation when indispensable
to  protect  his  constitutional  right  to  life,  liberty  and  property.  xxx  Rule  112
installed a quasi-judicial type of preliminary investigation conducted by one
whose  high  duty  is  to  be  fair  and  impartial.  A  PI  should  therefore  be
scrupulously conducted so that the constitutional right to liberty of a potential

accused  can  be  protected.  WE  UPHOLD  the  legal  basis  of  the  right  of
petitioners to demand from their prosecutor xxx  during their PI considering
their  exculpatory  character,  and  hence,  unquestionable  materiality  to  the
issue  of  their  probable  guilt.  The  right  is  rooted  on  the  constitutional
protection of due process which we rule to be operational even during PI of
potential accused.

An accused is denied his right to have compulsory process if he is not
provided the services of a qualified and competent interpreter to enable him
to present his testimony. (People vs Cuizon 256 SCRA 325)

A  generalized  assertion  of  executive  privilege  does  not  override  a
demonstrated  specific  need  for  evidence  in  a  pending  criminal  trial.  When
the ground for asserting the privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for
use   in  a   criminal   trial   is   based   only   on  the  generalized   interest   in
confidentiality,  it  cannot  prevail  over  the  fundamental  demands  of  due
process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice. The generalized
assertion  of  privilege  must  yield  to  the  demonstrated,  specific  need  for
evidence in a pending criminal trial. US vs Nixon 4188 US 683

Polygraph  evidence  is  not  yet  admissible  even  in  the  US.  US  vs
Scheffer 523 US 303

j) Trials In Absentia
Purpose of the provision: To speed up the disposition of criminal cases.
Nachura  p.  210.  Read  Sec  6,  Rule  120  of  the  Revised  Rules  on  Criminal
Procedure.  Trial  in  absentia  is  mandatory  upon  the  court  whenever  the
accused has been arraigned, notified of date/s of hearing, and his absence
is unjustified. Gimenez vs Nazareno 160 SCRA 1
Even after the accused has waived for further appearance during the
trial,  he  can  be  ordered  arrested  by  the  Court  for  non-appearance  upon
summons  to  appear  for  purposes  of  identification.  Carredo  vs  People  183
## SCRA 273

Presence of the accused is mandatory:
- during arraignment and plea
- during trial, for identification
- during promulgation of sentence, unless for a light offense wherein the
accused may appear by counsel or representative.


An accused who escapes from confinement, or jumps bail, or flees to
a foreign country, loses his standing in court, and unless he surrenders or
submits himself to the jurisdiction of the court he is deemed to have waived
his  right  to  seek  relief  from  the  court,  including  the  right  to  appeal  his
conviction. (People vs Mapalao 197 SCRA 79)

Trial  in  absentia  may  only  proceed  only  after  an  arraignment  (DP),
accused  had  been  duly  notified  of  the  trial  and  his  failure  to  appear  is
unjustified. (Gorospe Volume 2 p. 519)

There can be no arraignment or plea in absentia. (Nolasco vs Enrile)



Read  procedural  provisions  pertaining  to  the  Writ  of  Habeas
## Corpus

## Definition
It is an order by a competent court directing a person detaining another
requiring the former to produce the body of the detainee at a designated time
and place and show cause and explain the reason for such detention. It is
the best and sufficient remedy by judicial decree, to secure the freedom of
an illegally detained person.

It is regarded as a palladium of liberty, a prerogative writ which does
not issue as a matter of right but in the sound discretion of the court or judge.
(Caballes vs CA 452 SCRA 312)

## Objective
The  objective  of  the  writ  is  to  determine  whether  the  confinement  or
detention is valid or lawful. If it is, the writ cannot be issued. (Tung Chin Hui
vs Rodriguez 356 SCRA 31)

When available
HC lies only where the restraint of a person’s liberty has been judicially
adjudged to be illegal or unlawful. (In Re 251 SCRA 709).

The  writ  of  HC  shall  extend  to  all  cases  of  illegal  confinement  or
detention  by  which  any  person  is  deprived  of  his  liberty,  or  by  which  the
## 17. WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS


rightful custody  of any  person  is withheld  from  the  person  entitled  thereto.
(Sec 1 Rule 102 ROC).

Thus, it may be invoked where there is
a) arbitrary detention, or
b) when a  person was  convicted  by a court  without  jurisdiction  (over
the person or as to the cause)
c) or where continued imprisonment has become invalid or in excess
of the allowable period.

Such  a  sentence  is  void  only  as  to  the  excess  imposed  in  case  the
parts arre separable, the rule being that the petitioner is not entitled to his
discharge on a writ of HC unless he has served out so much of the sentence
as was valid. (Gumabon vs Director of Prisons 37 SCRA 420)

The  mere  loss  or  destruction  of  the  records  of  a  criminal  case
subsequent  to  the  conviction  of  the  accused  will  not  render  the  conviction
void such that release could be had by writ of HC. The proper remedy is to
seek for reconstitution of the judicial records. (Feria vs CA 325 SCRA 525)

Nevertheless, if due to the loss of the records of the cases, there was
failure  to  file  before  civilian  courts  the  corresponding  charges  against  the
prisoners  who  had  been  detained  by  virtue  of  their  previous  conviction  by
military commissions, then they should be released. (Ordonez vs Director
of Prisons 235 SCRA 152)

It is not physical restraint alone which is inquired into by the writ of HC.
Reservation in the form of restrictions attached to the temporary release of
a  detainee  constitutes  restraint  on  his  liberty  and  limit  his  freedom  of
movement of petitioner.

A release that renders a petition for a writ of HC moot and academic
must  be  one which is  free  from  involuntary  restraints.  Where  a  person
continues to be unlawfully DENIED (Moncupa vs Enrile 141 SCRA 233)

## Where –
- a  person  continues  to  be  unlawfully  denied  one  or  more  of  his
constitutional freedoms
- where there is a present denial of due process

- where  the  restraints  are  not  merely  involuntary  but  appear  to  be
unnecessary, and
- where  a  deprivation  of  freedom  originally  valid  has,  in  the  light  of
subsequent developments, become arbitrary
- unlawful denial of bail.

the  person  concerned  or  those  applying  in  his  behalf  may  still  avail
themselves of the privilege of the writ.

Where  the  decision  convicting  the  accused  is  already  final,  the
appropriate remedy of the convict who invokes the retroactive application of
the statute is to file a petition for HC, not an MR with modification of sentence.
(People vs Labriaga 250 SCRA 163).

Once a deprivation of a constitutional right is shown to exist, the court
that rendered the judgment is deemed ousted of jurisdiction and HC is the
appropriate  remedy  to  assail  the  legality  of  the  detention. (Gumabon  vs
Director of Prisons 37 SCRA 420)

It is likewise available in regard to custody of children (David vs CA
250 SCRA 82) but not for the purpose of compelling a spouse to live with the
other. (Ilusorio vs Bildner 332 SCRA 169)


GR 190108 So vs Tacla

In  general,  the  purpose  of  the  writ of  habeas  corpus  is  to  determine
whether or not a particular person is legally held. A prime specification of an
application for a writ of habeas corpus, in fact, is an actual and effective, and
not  merely  nominal  or  moral,  illegal  restraint  of  liberty.  The  writ  of  habeas
corpus was devised and exists as a speedy and effectual remedy to relieve
persons from unlawful restraint, and as the best and only sufficient defense
of  personal  freedom.  xxx  The  essential  object  and  purpose  of  the  writ  of
habeas  corpus is  to  inquire  into  all  manner  of  involuntary  restraint  as
distinguished  from  voluntary,  and  to  relieve  a  person  therefrom  if  such
restraint  is  illegal.  Any  restraint  which  will  preclude  freedom  of  action  is
sufficient.

The Rules on the Writs of Habeas Corpus and Amparo are clear; the
act   or   omission   or   the   threatened   act   or   omission   complained   of -

confinement  and  custody  for  habeas  corpus  and  violations  of,  or  threat  to
violate, a person’s life, liberty, and security for amparo cases - should  be
illegal or unlawful.
When not available

The general rule is that once the person detained is DULY CHARGED
IN  COURT,  he  may  no  longer  question  his  detention  by  a  petition  for  the
issuance of a writ of HC – his remedy would be the quashal of the information
or the warrant of arrest duly issued. (Bernarte vs CA 263 SCRA 323).

In this regard, the term “court” includes quasi-judicial  bodies  like  the
Deportation Board of the Bureau of Immigration. (Rodriguez vs Bonifacio
## 344 SCRA 519)

The ruling in Moncupa vs Enrile that HC will lie where the deprivation
of liberty which was initially valid has become arbitrary in view of subsequent
developments finds no application in the present case because the hearing
on petitioner’s application for bail has yet to commence. A petition for HC is
not  the  appropriate remedy for asserting one’s right to bail. It cannot be
availed of where the accused is entitled to bail not as a matter of right but on
the discretion of the court and the latter has not abused such or HAS NOT
even exercised the discretion. Remedy is to file for bail and to allow hearings
thereon.

The  fact  that  the  PI  was  invalid  and  that  the  offense  had  already
prescribed do not constitute valid grounds for the issuance of a writ of HC.
The  remedy  is  to  file  a  motion  to  quash  the  warrant  of  arrest, or  to  file  a
motion  to  quash  the  information  based  on  prescription. (Paredes  vs
Sandiganbayan 193 SCRA 464)
In  EXCEPTIONAL  CIRCUMSTANCES,  HC,  may  be  granted  by  the
courts even when the person concerned is detained pursuant to a valid arrest
or his voluntary surrender. (Serapio vs Sandiganbayan 396 SCRA 487)

## Vis-à-vis Certiorari

While  ordinarily,  the  writ  of  HC  will  not  be  granted  when  there  is  an
adequate  remedy  by  writ  of  error  or  appeal  or  by  writ  of  certiorari,  it  may,
nevertheless,  be  available  in  exceptional  cases,  for  the  writ  should  not  be
considered  subservient  to  procedural  limitations  which  glorify  form  over
substance. It must be kept  in mind  that  although the  questions most  often

considered  in  both  HC  and  certiorari  is  whether  an  inferior  court  has
exceeded  its  jurisdiction,  the  former  involves  a  collateral  attack  on  the
judgment and “reaches the body but not the record”, while the latter assails
directly the judgment and “reaches the record but not the body”.

Who may grant the writ
Sec 2 Rule 102 ROC. As provided in BP 129, a judge of the MTC may
issue  the  writ  if  all  the  judges  of  the  RTC  in  the  city  or  province  are  not
present.

Necessity of hearing
A court may grant the writ if it appears upon the petition that the writ of
HC ought to be issued – no hearing is required before the writ may be issued.
(Tan vs Adre 450 SCRA 145)


To whom addressed
Officer under whom another is in detention or in alleged illegal custody.
In  one  case,  however,  the  Court  said  that  the  judge  who  issued  the  order
and warrant for such person’s arrest, thus with constructive custody, might
be made respondent. (Calvan vs CA 341 SCRA 806)

## Contempt
There  is  a  need  to  comply  with  the  writ;  disobedience  thereof
constitutes contempt of court. (Contado vs Tan 160 SCRA 404)

Suspension of the Privilege of the Writ

In cases of invasion OR rebellion WHEN public safety requires it.

Effect of suspension:
The suspension of the privilege of the writ shall apply only to persons
judicially charged for rebellion or offenses inherent in or directly connected
with invasion.
During  the  suspension  of  the  privilege  of  the  writ,  any  person  thus
arrested or detained shall be judicially released within three days, otherwise
he  shall   be   released.     (Art.  VII,  Sec.   18,   5
th
and   6
th
pars.,   1987
## Constitution)

Congressional participation

Within 48 hours from the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus the
President shall submit a reporting person or in writing to the Congress.  The
Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in
regular or special session, may revoke such suspension, which revocation
shall not be set aside by the President.  Upon the initiative of the President,
the  Congress  may,  in  the  same  manner,  extend  such  proclamation  or
suspension for a period to be determined by the Congress, if the invasion or
rebellion shall persist and public safety requires it.
The  Congress,  if  not  in  session,  shall,  within  24  hours  following  such
suspension convene in accordance with its rules without need of a call.  (Art.
VII, Sec. 18, 1
st
and 2
nd
pars., 1987 Constitution)



Supreme Court review of suspension
The Supreme Court may review, in an appropriate proceeding filed by
any  citizen,  the  sufficiency  of  the  factual  basis  of    the  suspension  of  the
privilege  of  the  writ  or  the  extension  thereof,  and  must  promulgate  its
decision thereon within thirty days from its filing.  (Art. VII, Sec. 18, 3
rd
par.,
## 1987 Constitution)

What is suspended is merely the right of the individual to seek release
from  detention through the writ of HC as  a  speedy means  of  obtaining  his
liberty. (Aberca  vs  Ver  160  SCRA  590). The  suspension  is  supposed  to
enable the Government to deal more effectively with the rebellion or invasion
that  might  be  afoot.  Note  however  the  JUDICIALLY  CHARGED  provision
and the RIGHT TO BAIL provision.


a) Writ of Amparo
Read  A.M.  No.  07-9-12-SC - THE  RULE  ON  THE  WRIT  OF
## AMPARO

The  amparo  production  order  may  be likened  to  the  production  of
documents or things under Section 1, Rule 27 of the Rules of Civil Procedure
and should not be confused with a search warrant for law enforcement under
Article  III,  Section  2  of  the  1987  Constitution. (Secretary  of  National
Defense vs Manalo GR 180906)


No writ of Amparo may be issued unless there is a clear allegation of
the supposed factual and legal basis of the right sought to be protected. The
writ  shall  issue  if  the  Court  is  preliminary  satisfied  with  the  prima  facie
existence  of  the  ultimate  facts determinable  from  the  supporting  affidavits
that detail the circumstances of how and to what extent a threat to or violation
of the rights to life, liberty and security of the aggrieved party was or is being
committed. (Canlas vs Naapico 554 SCRA 208)

As the Amparo Rule was intended to address the intractable problem
of “extralegal killings” and “enforced disappearances”, its coverage, in its
present form, is confined to these two instances or to threats thereof.
Extralegal killings – Killings committed without due process of law ie
without legal safeguards or judicial proceedings.

Enforced     disappearances – Attended     by     the     following
characteristics:   an   arrest,   detention,   or   abduction   of   a   person   by   a
government official or organized groups or private individuals acting with the
direct or indirect acquiescence of the government; the refusal of the State to
disclose  the fate  or  whereabouts  of  the  person  concerned  or  a  refusal  to
acknowledge  the  deprivation  of  liberty  which  places  such  persons  outside
the protection of the law.

Evolution of the writ
- amparo libertad for the protection of personal freedom, equivalent
to the HC writ
- amparo contra leyes for the judicial review of the constitutionality
of statutes
- amparo casacion for the judicial review of the constitutionality and
legality of a judicial decision
- amparo  administrativo for  the  judicial  review  of  administrative
actions
- amparo agrario for the protection of peasant’s rights derived from
the agrarian reform process


The writ of amparo serves both PREVENTIVE and CURATIVE roles in
addressing the problem of extralegal killings and enforced disappearances.
It  is  PREVENTIVE  in  that  it  breaks  the  expectation  of  impunity  in  the
commission  of  these  offenses.;  it  is  CURATIVE  in  that  it  facilitates  the

subsequent investigation and action. (Sec of Natl Defense vs Manalo 568
## SCRA 1)

Permutations of the right to security of person
- The right to security of person is freedom from fear.
- The  right  of  security  is  a  guarantee  of  bodily and  psychological
integrity or security
- The right to security of a person is a guarantee of protection of one’s
rights  by  the  government. (Secretary  of  National  Defense  vs
Manalo GR 180906)

In  an  Amparo  proceeding  re  the  case  of Melissa  Roxas: G.R.  No.
189155 , the doctrines were as follows:

As to the doctrine of Command Responsibility

It  must  be  stated  at  the  outset  that  the  use  by  the  petitioner  of  the
doctrine  of  command  responsibility  as  the  justification  in  impleading  the
public  respondents  in  her  amparo  petition,  is  legally  inaccurate,  if  not
incorrect. The doctrine of command responsibility is a rule of substantive law
that establishes liability and, by this account, cannot be a proper legal basis
to  implead  a  party-respondent  in  an  amparo  petition.  (She  would  like  to
implicate high-ranking officials in this petition)

Command  responsibility  is  "an  omission  mode  of  individual  criminal
liability," whereby the superior is made responsible for crimes committed by
his subordinates for failing to prevent or punish the perpetrators.

SC said:
While   the   principal   objective   of   its   proceedings   is   the   initial
determination  of  whether  an  enforced  disappearance,  extralegal  killing  or
threats thereof had transpired—the writ does not, by so doing, fix liability for
such disappearance, killing or threats, whether that may be criminal, civil or
administrative under the applicable substantive law.

The Secretary of National Defense v. Manalo

The remedy provides rapid judicial relief as it partakes of a summary
proceeding that requires only substantial evidence to make the appropriate
reliefs available to the petitioner; it is not an action to determine criminal guilt

requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt, or liability for damages requiring
preponderance   of   evidence,   or   administrative   responsibility   requiring
substantial evidence that will require full and exhaustive proceedings.

It must be clarified, however, that the inapplicability of the doctrine of
command responsibility in an amparo proceeding does not, by any measure,
preclude  impleading military  or  police commanders  on the  ground that the
complained  acts  in  the petition were committed with their  direct  or  indirect
acquiescence. In which case, commanders may be impleaded—not actually
on  the  basis  of  command  responsibility—but  rather  on  the  ground  of  their
responsibility, or at least accountability.

Razon v. Tagitis

Responsibility refers to the extent the actors have been established by
substantial  evidence  to  have  participated  in  whatever  way,  by  action  or
omission, in an enforced disappearance, as a measure of the remedies this
Court shall craft,  among them, the  directive  to  file the  appropriate  criminal
and civil cases against the responsible parties in the proper courts.

Accountability, on the other hand, refers to the measure of remedies
that should be addressed to those who exhibited involvement in the enforced
disappearance without  bringing  the  level  of  their  complicity  to  the  level  of
responsibility defined above; or who are imputed with knowledge relating to
the enforced disappearance and who carry the burden of disclosure; or those
who carry, but have failed to discharge, the burden of extraordinary diligence
in the investigation of the enforced disappearance.

DEGREE OF PROOF NEEDED – Substantial Evidence.

Direct  evidence  of  identity,  when  obtainable,  must  be  preferred  over
mere circumstantial evidence based on patterns and similarity, because the
former indubitably offers greater certainty as to the true identity and affiliation
of the perpetrators.
Re:  Her  prayer  for  Return  of  personal  Belongings:  It  was  denied
because of the following reasons:
1)  An  order  directing  the  public  respondents  to  return  the  personal
belongings   of   the   petitioner   is   already   equivalent   to   a   conclusive
pronouncement of liability. The order itself is a substantial relief that can only
be granted once the liability of the public respondents has been fixed in a full

and exhaustive proceeding. As already discussed above, matters of liability
are not determinable in a mere summary amparo proceeding
2) Section 1 of the Amparo Rule, which defines the scope and extent
of the writ, clearly excludes the protection of property rights.
Re: Inspection orders under the remedy

An  inspection  order  is  an  interim  relief  designed  to  give  support  or
strengthen the claim of a petitioner in an amparo petition, in order to aid the
court before making a decision.A basic requirement before an amparo court
may grant an inspection order is that the place to be inspected is reasonably
determinable from the allegations of the party seeking the order. While the
Amparo  Rule  does  not  require that  the  place to  be inspected  be  identified
with clarity and precision, it is, nevertheless, a minimum for the issuance of
an inspection order that the supporting allegations of a party be sufficient in
itself, so as to make a prima facie case

Yano vs Sanchez GR 186640

The failure to establish that the public official observed extraordinary
diligence in the performance of duty does not result in the automatic grant of
the  privilege  of  the amparo writ.  It  does  not  relieve  the  petitioner  from
establishing  his  or  her  claim  by substantial  evidence.  The  omission  or
inaction on the part of the public official provides, however, some basis for
the petitioner to move and for the court to grant certain interim reliefs. Eg.
TPO, IO, PO. These provisional reliefs are intended to assist the court before
it arrives at a judicious determination of the amparo petition. For the appellate
court to, in the present case, still order the inspection of the military camps
and order the army units to conduct an investigation into the disappearance
of Nicolas and Heherson after it absolved petitioners is thus not in order. The
reliefs granted by the appellate court to respondents are not in sync with a
finding that petitioners could not be held accountable for the disappearance
of the victims.

***La lang - It would be grave error to grant the relief prayed for without
violating  the  well-settled  rule  that  a  party  who  does  not  appeal  from  the
decision may not obtain any affirmative relief from the appellate court other
than  what  he  has  obtained  from  the  lower  court,  if  any,  whose  decision  is
brought up on appeal. The rule is clear that no modification of judgment could
be granted to a party who did not appeal.


To start off with the basics, the writ of amparo was originally conceived
as a response to the extraordinary rise in the number of killings and enforced
disappearances,  and  to  the  perceived  lack  of  available  and  effective
remedies to address these extraordinary concerns. It is intended to address
violations  of  or  threats  to  the  rights  to  life,  liberty  or  security,  as  an
extraordinary  and  independent  remedy  beyond  those  available  under  the
prevailing Rules, or as a remedy supplemental to these Rules. What it is not,
is a writ to protect concerns that are purely property or commercial. Neither
is  it a  writ  that  we  shall  issue  on  amorphous  and  uncertain  grounds.
Consequently, the Rule on the Writ of Amparo – in line with the extraordinary
character of the writ and the reasonable certainty that its issuance demands
– requires that every petition for the issuance of the writ must be supported
by justifying allegations of fact,(Castillo vs Cruz GR 182165)

Take Note:
Section 22. Effect of Filing of a Criminal Action. – When a criminal
action has been commenced, no separate petition for the writ shall be filed.
The reliefs under the writ shall be available by motion in the criminal case.


Right to Life, Liberty and Security defined: (Fr Reyes vs Gonzalez GR
## 182161)

In Secretary of National Defense et al. v. Manalo et al., the Court
explained the concept of right to life in this wise:
While the right to life under Article III, Section 1 guarantees essentially
the  right  to  be  alive- upon  which  the  enjoyment  of  all  other  rights  is
preconditioned - the right to security of person is a guarantee of the secure
quality of this life, viz: "The life to which each person has a right is not a life
lived in fear that his person and property may be unreasonably violated by a
powerful ruler. Rather, it is a life lived with the assurance that the government
he established and consented to, will protect the security of his person and
property. The ideal of security in life and property... pervades the whole
history of man. It touches every aspect of man’s existence." In a broad sense,
the  right  to  security  of  person  "emanates  in  a  person’s  legal  and
uninterrupted  enjoyment  of  his life,  his  limbs,  his body,  his  health,  and  his
reputation. It includes the right to exist, and the right to enjoyment of life while
existing, and it is invaded not only by a deprivation of life but also of those
things which are necessary to the enjoyment of life according to the nature,
temperament, and lawful desires of the individual."


The  right  to  liberty,  on the  other  hand,  was  defined  in  the City  of
Manila, et al. v. Hon. Laguio, Jr.,in this manner:

Liberty  as  guaranteed  by  the  Constitution  was  defined  by  Justice
Malcolm to include "the right to exist and the right to be free from arbitrary
restraint or servitude. The term cannot be dwarfed into mere freedom from
physical restraint of the person of the citizen, but is deemed to embrace the
right of man to enjoy the facilities with which he has been endowed by his
Creator,  subject  only  to  such  restraint  as  are  necessary  for  the  common
welfare." x x x

Secretary  of  National  Defense  et  al.  v.  Manalo  et  al thoroughly
expounded on the import of the right to security, thus:
A  closer  look  at  the  right  to  security  of  person  would  yield  various
permutations of the exercise of this right.

First,  the  right  to  security  of  person  is  "freedom  from  fear."  In  its
"whereas"  clauses,  the Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights (UDHR)
enunciates  that  "a  world  in  which  human  beings  shall  enjoy  freedom  of
speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as
the  highest  aspiration  of  the  common  people."  (emphasis  supplied)  Some
scholars  postulate  that  "freedom  from  fear"  is not  only  an  aspirational
principle, but essentially an individual international human right. It is the "right
to security of person" as the word "security" itself means "freedom from fear."
Article 3 of the UDHR provides, viz:
Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. Thus, in
the amparo context,  it  is  more  correct  to  say  that  the  "right  to  security"  is
actually the "freedom from threat." Viewed in this light, the "threatened with
violation" Clause in the latter part of Section 1 of the Amparo Rule is a form
of  violation  of  the  right  to  security  mentioned  in  the  earlier  part  of  the
provision. Second, the right to security of person is a guarantee of bodily and
psychological integrity or security. Third, the right to security of person is a
guarantee of protection of one’s rights by the government.
The writ of amparo should not issue when applied for as a substitute
for the  appeal  or certiorari  process,  or when it  will  ordinately  interfere  with
these processes. (Tapuz vs del Rosario 554 SCRA 768)



## 18. SELF-INCRIMINATION CLAUSE



It prescribes an option of refusal to answer the incriminating questions
and not a prohibition of inquiry. (People vs Ayson 175 SCRA 216)

a) Scope and Coverage

In  determining  the  circumstances  in  which  the  privilege  may  be
invoked, one would have to take into account the NATURE of the evidence,
the  PERSONALITY  of  the  person  invoking  it,  and  the  PROCEEDING
involved.
The  right  is  available  not  only  in criminal  proceedings,  but also  in  all
other government proceedings, including civil actions and administrative or
legislative investigations.

May  be  claimed  not  only  by  the  accused  but  also  by  the  witness  to
whom an incriminating question is addressed.

It applies only to testimonial compulsion and production of documents,
papers  and  chattels  in  court  except  when  books  of  account  are  to  be
examined in the exercise of PP and the power of taxation. An accused MAY
BE  COMPELLED  to  be  photographed  or  measured,  his  garments  may  be
removed, and his body may be examined. (p 389 Duka)

The  privilege  is basically  directed  at  testimonial  evidence  or  any
evidence  COMMUNICATIVE  in  nature  acquired  from  the  accused  under
duress.  Thus,  it  would  not  be  implicated  if  it  is  physical  evidence  that  is
sought to be taken from a person or otherwise sought to be produced, except
when these are personal papers (inclusion of his “body” in evidence is not
prohibited i.e. hair, DNA, substance, paraffin test)

It is available to one who might be guilty or one who simply professes
innocence

Does  not  extend to  private  investigations  done  by  private  individuals
(BPI vs Casa 430 SCRA 261.)

It  is  available  to  him  in  a  preliminary  investigation  before  the  public
prosecutor’s office.


The  right  has  no  application  to  juridical  persons.  Reason  is  that
corporations are mere creatures of the State

In  US  vs  Wade,  the  court  held  that  compelling  the  suspect  to  speak
within hearing distance from the witnesses is not violative of this provision. It
was  not  compulsion  to  utter  statements  of  a  testimonial  nature;  he  was
required to use his voice as an identifying PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTIC,
not to speak his guilt.
The privilege has consistently been held to extend to all proceedings
sanctioned  by  law  and  to  all  cases  in  which  punishment  is  sought  to  be
visited  upon  the  witness,  whether  a party  or  not.  p.  389  Duka  It  is  not  the
character of the suit but the NATURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS that controls.
(Rosete vs Lim GR 136051)

General Rule – Only an accused in a criminal case can refuse to take the
witness stand. The right to refuse to take the stand does not generally apply
to parties in admin cases or proceedings

## Exception –
a) In admin cases/ proceedings that partook of the nature of a criminal
proceeding or analogous to a criminal proceeding. Eg one resulting in loss
of license, profession, employment, or forfeiture of property.
b) It is likewise the opinion of the court that said esception applies to
parties in civil actions which are criminal in nature. Rosete vs Lim GR 136051

Right of defendant in a criminal case

He can altogether refuse to testify or produce evidence in the criminal
case  in  which  he  is  the  accused,  or one  of  the  accused.  He  cannot  be
compelled to do so even by subpoena or other process or order of the Court.
He cannot be required to be a witness either for the prosecution, or for a co-
accused, or even for himself. His neglect or refusal to be a witness shall not
in any manner prejudice or be used against him. (p. 397 Duka)

Right of a party in a civil/admin case or legislative investigations

He may be compelled to testify by subpoena, having only the right to
refuse  to  answer  a  particular  incriminatory  question  at  the  time  it  is  put  to
him. (p. 388 Duka)


## 1) Foreign Laws
In US vs Balsys, it was held that the privilege against self-incrimination
may not be invoked even if faced with possibility of incrimination in regard to
criminal laws of other countries and not within the jurisdiction of the State in
which the proceedings are held.In this case, Balsys was invoking the right
against self-incrimination  when asked about his wartime activities during the
## 1
st
World  War  during  an  investigation  conducted  by  the  Office  of  Special
Investigations  of  the  Criminal  Division  of  the  US  DOJ  regarding  the
correctness of the information contained in his immigrant VISA saying that
his answers might subject him to criminal prosecution in Lithuania, Israel and
## Germany.

b) Application

The right may be waived, expressly, or impliedly, as by failure to claim
it at the appropriate time. (Duka p. 396)

Thus, if he wish to testify, he has such right. But if he does testify, then
he  may  be  cross-examined  as  to  any  matters  stated  in  his  direct  or
connected therewith. He may not on cross refuse to answer any question on
the ground that the answer that he will give, or the evidence he will produce,
would  have  a  tendency  to  incriminate  him  for  the  crime  with  which  he  is
charged. IT MUST HOWEVER be made clear that if the defendant in a CRIM
action  be  asked  a  question  which  might  incriminate  him,  not  for  the  crime
with  which  he  is  charged,  BUT  FOR  SOME  OTHER  CRIME,  distinct  from
that  of  which  he  is  accused,  he  may  invoke  the  right  against  self-
incrimination. (People vs Ayson GR 85215)

A person cannot be compelled to produce a sample of his handwriting
as  it  is  not  a  purely  mechanical  act  ,  but  requires  the  application  of
intelligence and attention. (Beltran vs Samson GR 32025.)
See Bar Exam Q and A in page 401 of Duka.

Effect of violation –
Section 12(3), Article III, Bill of Rights. This exclusionary rule applies
not only to confessions but also to admissions, whether made by a witness
in any proceeding or by an accused in a criminal procceding or any person
under investigation for the commission of an offense. (Galman vs Pamaran
## 138 SCRA 294)


c) Immunity Statutes

This is one of the exceptions to the right of an accused not to take the
witness stand – when he is covered by an immunity statute, in which case
he may not refuse to answer incriminatory questions. This applies as well to
any  other  person  whose  possibly  incriminating  testimony  is  required  to  be
disclosed by applicable immunity statutes.

1). Transactional  Immunity  Statutes – Grants  immunity  to  the
witness  from  prosecution  for  an  offense  to  which  his  compelled  testimony
relates.
2).  Use immunity – Prohibits use of witness’ compelled testimony and
its  fruits  in  any  manner  in  connection  with  the  criminal  prosecution  of  the
witness. (Duka p. 395)

The  Constitutional  provision  does not  impose  on  the  judge,  or  other
officer  presiding  over  the  trial,  hearing  or  investigation  any  affirmative
obligation  to  advise  the  witness  of  his  right  against  self-I. Ignorantia  Legis
## Non Excusat.




For as long as those ideas are simply matters of the mind, or expressed
in accordance with lawful avenues, those holding them should not suffer any
political persecution or imprisonment simply because they think differently or
not in conformity with the prevailing views. (Just like in freedom of religion).
If those ideas and aspirations get to be expressed through unlawful means,
however, then that is the time when the authorities may apply the law and
put  their  adherents  behind  bar,  not  because  of  what  they  believe  in  but
because of what they have done.

Involuntary  servitude  denotes  a  condition  of  enforced,  compulsory
service of one to another. Rubi vs Provincial Board of Mindoro 39 Phil 660

The constitutional provision on fines and punishments addresses itself
to the form, extent and duration of punishment that reasonably may be meted
out on anyone found guilty of committing an offense against the State.
In People vs Estoesta (93 Phil 647), it was held that it takes more than
merely being harsh, excessive, out of proportion, or severe for a penalty to
be  obnoxious  to  the  Constitution.  The  punishment  must  be  flagrantly  and
plainly oppressive, wholly disproportionate to the nature of the offenseas to
shock the moral sense of the community.

The  Constitutional  proscription  against  the  imposition  of  excessive
fines applies only to criminal prosecutions. (Serrano vs NLRC 331 SCRA
## 331)

Punishment  is  CDI  if  it  involves  torture  or  lingering  death.  It  implies
something   inhuman   and   barbarous,   something   more   than   the   mere
extinguishment of life. A fine is excessive when under the circumstances, it
is disproportionate to the offense (Bernas p. 178)
## 20. EXCESSIVE FINES AND CRUEL AND INHUMAN
## PUNISHMENTS



The following may be used as guides for determining whether a
punishment is cruel and unusual:
- A punishment must not be so severe as to be degrading to the dignity
of human beings
- It must not be applied arbitrarily
- It must not be unacceptable to contemporary society
- It must not be excessive (Furman vs Georgia 408 US 238)

People vs Echegaray
The constitutional exercise of the Congress’ limited power to re-impose
the death penalty entails the following:
- That Congress define or describe what is meant by heinous crimes
- That Congress specify and penalize by death, only crimes that qualify
as heinous in accordance with the definition or description set in the
death penalty bill and/or designate crimes punishable by RP to death
in which latter case, death can only be imposed upon the attendance
of circumstances duly proven in court that characterize the crime to be
heinous in accordance with the definition or description set in the death
penalty bill;
- That  Congress,  in  enacting  this  death  penalty  bill  be  singularly
motivated by compelling reasons involving heinous crimes.

In Roper vs Simmons, it was held that the US Constitution forbids the
imposition of death penalty on offenders who were under the age of 18 when
their crimes were committed – i.e that the death penalty is disproportionate
punishment  for  offenders under  18.  So  is  the  application  to  mentally
retardates. (Atkins vs Virginia 536 US 304)

Imprisonment is the detention of another against the his will depriving
him of his power of locomotion and it is something more than mere loss of
freedom. It includes the notion of restraint within the limits defined by wall or
any exterior barrier. (People vs Jalosjos 324 SCRA 689).

A prisoner is not wholly stripped of constitutional protections when he
is  imprisoned  for  a  crime.  There  is  no  iron  curtain  drawn  between  the
Constitution  and the  prisons of this  country,  e.g.  they are  entitled to  equal
protection and due process as well as access to the courts (Cruz vs Beto
## 405 US 319)


Prison  disciplinary  proceedings  are  not  part  of  criminal  prosecution,
and the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such proceeding does not
apply.  Eg  the  right  to  confront  and  cross  examination  does  not  apply  or
counsel. (Wolff vs Mcdonell 418 US 539)
A  lesser  standard  of  review  than  strict  scrutiny  is  appropriate  in
determining the constitutionality of prison rules. (Turner vs Faffley 482 US
## 78)



No person may be imprisoned for debt in virtue of an order in a civil
proceeding, either as a substitute for satisfaction of a debt or as a means of
compelling satisfaction; but a person may be imprisoned as a penalty for a
crime  arising  from  a  contractual  debt  and  imposed  in  a  proper  criminal
proceeding. (Bernas p. 179)

Fraudulent debt
A person may be imprisoned for such only if
a) the fraudulent debt constitutes a crime
b) the debtor has been duly convicted (Bernas p. 179)
The  conversion  of  the  monetary  indemnity,  imposed  as  part  of  a
criminal penalty, into subsidiary imprisonment does not violate the prohibition
of  imprisonment  of  debt  since  the  obligation  to  indemnify  was  not  ex
contractu but ex delicto. (Alejo vs Judge Inserto AM 1098)

Poll tax – Cedula tax or residence tax.

The  Constitution  does  not  prohibit  the  cedula  tax  but  it  prohibits
imprisonment  for  non-payment  of  the  cedula  or  residence  tax. (Bernas  p.
## 180)

The gravamen of the offense punished by BP 22 is the act of making
and  issuing  a  worthless  check  or  a  check  that  is  dishonored  upon  its
presentation  for  payment.  It  is  not the  non-payment  of an  obligation which
the  law  punishes.  Hence,  it does  not  violate this  provision. (Lozano  vs
Martinez 146 SCRA 323)



## 21. NON-IMPRISONMENT FOR DEBTS

## 22. DOUBLE JEOPARDY
## 22.

a) Requisites – Discussions herein were taken from book of Bernas which I
believe contains the most exhaustive and significant discussions about the
subject.
Requisites for valid defense of DJ
## A)  1
st
jeopardy must have attached prior to the 2
nd

## B)  1
st
jeopardy must have terminated
C)  the 2
nd
jeopardy must be for the same offense as that in the 1
st


Elements of (A)/Jeopardy of punishment attaches:
- upon a good indictment
- before a competent court
- after arraignment
- after plea

Presentation of evidence contrary to plea and to withdrawal of original
plea such that (4) is not present (as in effect there is no valid plea) and hence,
## 1
st
jeopardy did not attach.

Defective complaint, resulting to quashal did not place the accused in
## 1
st
jeopardy

When is 1
st
jeopardy terminated/when does (B) takes place?
- by acquittal
- final conviction
- dismissal without express consent of the accused
- dismissal  on  the  merits – includes  dismissal  by  virtue  of  the  right  to
speedy trial

General  Rule: The  dismissal  or  termination  of  the  case  after  arraignment
and plea to valid information shall be a bar. (There is valid defense of DJ)

Exception: 1) Dismissal is made upon motion or the express consent of the
defendant
2) Dismissal not an acquittal or based upon consideration of the
evidence or of the merits of the case
3)  Question  to  be  passed  upon  by  the  appellate  court  is  purely
legal so that should the dismissal be found incorrect, the case would have to
be remanded to court of origin for further proceedings.


Take Note: When the dismissal of the case clearly constitutes grave abuse
of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction, the dismissal, even if made on
the merits, is invalid and is therefore no bar to the reinstatement of the case.


Test to determine if (C) is present
- whether one offense is identical with the other
- or whether it is an attempt or frustration of the other
- or whether one offense necessarily includes or is necessarily included
in the other offense charged in the former complaint or information

Offenses need not be the same PROV that they flow from the same act.
it will be different however if the act violated 2 different statutes. There is no
DJ in one against the other.

General Rule: If acquitted, appeal of the Government may not be had
Exception: If acquittal were characterized with grave abuse of discretion ie
prosecution was not given due process.

b) MR and Appeals

Judgment of CONVICTION

## Appeal
A judgment of conviction could ONLY be reconsidered or appealed at
the initiative of the accused. When the accused decides to simply serve his
sentence or pay his fine that is the end of the case. The prosecution may not
move for recon or appeal the judgment as the same would place the accused
in DJ. The prosecution could also not appeal for the purpose of increasing
the penalty. (People vs Leones 366 SCRA 535)

However when the accused himself appeals, he stands the chance of
having his penalty increased since an appeal in a criminal case throws open
the  whole  case  for  review,  including  the  penalty  imposed. (People  vs
Rondero 320 SCRA 383)

## MR
In case of MR, it was held that when the accused files or consents to
the  filing  of  the  MR  or  modification,  double  jeopardy  cannot  be  invoked
because the accused waived his right not to be placed therein by filing such

motion. His motion gives the court an opportunity to rectify his errors or to
reevaluate its assessment of facts and conclusions of law and make them
conformable with the statute applicable to the case in the new judgment it
has to render. In effect, an MR or modification filed by or with the consent of
the accused renders the entire evidence open for the review of the trial court
without,  however,  conducting  further  proceedings  such  as  the  taking  of
additional proof. (People vs Astudillo 410 SCRA 723)

Judgment of ACQUITTAL
The  accused  can  not  anymore  be  imperiled  by  the  prosecutor  either
seeking a recon or appeal from it. If there was a grave abuse of discretion,
that would be a different story. Without jurisdiction, the court cannot proceed
to render a valid judgment. Thus the prosecution may elevate the matter to
an  appellate  court  by  means  of  certiorari. (Yuchengco  vs  CA  376  SCRA
## 531)

c) Dismissal with Consent of the Accused

When the case is dismissed with the express consent of the defendant,
the dismissal will not be a bar to another prosecution for the same offense;
because, his action in having the case dismissed constitutes a waiver of his
constitutional right or privilege, for the reason that he thereby prevents the
court from proceeding to the trial on the merits and rendering a judgment of
conviction against him. (People vs Salico)

The application of the sister doctrines of waiver and estoppel requires
two sine qua non conditions:
first,  the  dismissal  must  be  sought  or  induced  by  the  defendant
personally or through his counsel.
Second, dismissal must not be on the merits and must not necessarily
amount to an acquittal. (People vs Obsania 23 SCRA 1249)

General Rule: The termination of the case other than on acquittal or
conviction of the accused, which dismissal is brought about by the accused
himself is not bar to further prosecution
## Exception:
a) Demurrer  to  Evidence – D  to  E  being  favorably  acted  upon,  the
acquittal results from the fact that the prosecution has not really presented
that   amount   of   evidence   sufficient   to   overcome   the   presumption   of

innocence. Where the prosecution evidence could not sustain a conviction,
there is no point in still requiring the accused to present his evidence.
b)    Right to Speedy Trial – In effect, the State has failed to prove its
case within a reasonable period of time.

*** In the  case  of Dela Rosa  vs CA the Court set forth the  requisites that
must occur for legal jeopardy to attach which are:
- valid complaint or infor
- court of competent jurisdiction
- accused has pleaded to the charge
- The accused has been convicted or acquitted OR the case dismissed
or terminated without the express consent of the accused.






EPF Laws - It is a law which penalizes a person for having committed an act
which  was  not  punishable  at  the  time of  its  commission.    Such  retroactive
application violates a person’s right to due process.

Kinds of EPF Laws
An ex post facto law is one that:
1)  Makes criminal an act done before the passage of the law and which
was innocent when done, and punishes such an act;
2)    Aggravates  a  crime,  or  makes  it greater  than  it  was,  when
committed;
3)  Changes the punishment and inflicts a greater punishment than the
law annexed to the crime when committed;
4)  Alters the  legal  rules  of  evidence,  and  authorizes conviction  upon
less or different testimony than the law required at the time of the commission
of the offense;
5)    Assuming  to  regulate  civil  rights  and  remedies  only,  in  effect
imposes penalty or deprivation of a right for something which when done was
lawful; and
6)  Deprives a person accused of a crime of some lawful protection to
which he has become entitled, such as the protection of a former conviction
or  acquittal,  or  a  proclamation  of  amnesty.   (In  re  Kay  Villegas  Kami,  35
## SCRA 429)
## 23.    EX   POST    FACTO    LAWS    AND   BILL    OF
## ATTAINDER
## 22.22.


Characteristics of EPF laws
To be EPF the law must:
- must refer to criminal matters (penal)
- be retroactive in its application
- to the prejudice of the accused. (Cruz p. 268)

As to requirement No 1
Penal  law  is  one  that  prescribes  a  criminal  penalty  imposable  in  a
criminal  trial.  A law  is  also  penal  if  it  prescribes  a  burden  equivalent  to  a
criminal penalty (e.g. disqualification from the practice of a profession) even
if  such  burden  is  imposed  in  an  administrative  proceeding.   (Pascual  v.
Board of Medical Examiners, 28 SCRA 344).

However,  a  law  on  criminal  procedure  which  alters  the  legal  rules  of
evidence  or  mode  of  trial  can  be  an  EPF  law  unless  the  changes  operate
only  in  a  limited  and  unsubstantial  manner  to  the  disadvantage  of  the
accused. (Beazell vs Ohio 269 US 167)

Bill  of Attainder - It  is  a  law  that  inflicts  punishment  without  a  trial,
substituting the legislative act for a judicial determination of guilt.  It violates
the  right  s  of  the  accused  to  be  presumed  innocent  and  to  seek  a  proper
remedy before a court of law.

If a statute is a bill of attainder, it is an EPF law. But if it is not an ex
post facto law, the reasons that establish that it is not are PERSUASIVE that
it cannot be a bill of attainder. (Cruz. P. 271)

Essential elements of a BOA
- There must be a law
- The law imposes a penal burden (same sense as “penal” in EPF law;
(pls    see    previous    discussion)on    named    individual    or    easily
ascertainable members of a group
- The penal burden is imposed directly by the law WITHOUT judicial trial
