## Frequently Asked Questions

## A. Overview

- What is impeachment? What is the purpose of impeachment?

Impeachment refers to the power of Congress to remove a public official for serious crimes or
misconduct as provided in the Constitution. [Corona v. Senate, G.R. No. 200242 (2012)]. It is
“a proceeding exercised by the legislative, as representatives of the sovereign, to vindicate the
breach of the trust reposed by the people in the hands of the public officer by determining the
public officer's fitness to stay in the office.” [Republic v. Sereno, G.R. No. 237428 (2018)].

An impeachment proceeding is sui generis, “a class of its own.” It is neither civil nor criminal
in character. Unlike traditional legal proceedings, impeachment is quintessentially political,
with  facts  and  law  being  weighed  not  by specially trained  judges  but  by popularly  elected
members of Congress.

- Which officials may be impeached?

Under Article XI, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution, the following are impeachable officers:

## 1. The President
- The Vice-President
- Members of the Supreme Court
- Members   of   the   Constitutional   Commissions, i.e.,   Civil   Service   Commission,
Commission on Audit, and Commission on Elections
## 5. The Ombudsman

This is an exclusive enumeration as all other public officers and employees may be removed
from office as provided by law, but not by impeachment. [Const. art. XI, § 2].

- What are the grounds for impeachment?

The following are grounds for impeachment:

- Culpable violation of the Constitution
## 2. Treason
## 3. Bribery
- Graft and corruption
- Other high crimes, or
- Betrayal of public trust [Const. art. XI, § 2].

Because of the rarity and political character of impeachment, we do not have guidance from
courts on the conclusive meaning of these grounds. But based on the text of the Constitution
alone,  to  be  impeachable,  the  violation  of  the  Constitution  must  be  “culpable,” i.e.,  of  a
character worthy of punishment.

Treason, bribery, and graft and corruption are currently defined by various laws, such as the
Revised Penal Code and Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.
However, these statutes are separate from the Constitution, and how Congress has defined
these acts in the past does not need to bind the current or a future congress’s understanding
of these grounds.

High crimes are understood in American law as acts that are of a “sufficient seriousness as to
justify the belief that there was a grave violation of the trust imposed on the official sought to
be impeached,” [Rec. Const. Comm’n No. 040 (July 26, 1986)] even if they may not necessarily
be chargeable in a court. Finally, betrayal of public trust was intended to be a catch-all and
reflects  the  relaxation  of  the  grounds  for  impeachment as  a  measure  against  its  over-
legalization. [See id.]

- What is the difference between impeachment and a criminal case?

An impeachment proceeding is sui generis, i.e., “of its own kind” or in a class of its own. Its
sole   function   is to   remove   an   impeachable   officer and   disqualify her from further
officeholding. It is quintessentially political, and it is neither civil, criminal, nor administrative
in  nature. It  is  only  preparatory  to  liability  as  no  legally  actionable  liability  attaches  to  the
public officer by a mere judgment of impeachment against her. [In re: Letter of Mrs. Corona,
A.M. No. 20-07-10-SC (2021)]. A conviction in impeachment does not result in imprisonment
as in a criminal conviction. [See Const. art. IX, § 3(7)]

Unlike in criminal proceedings, proof beyond reasonable doubt is not required for conviction
in impeachment. Past Senates have also declined to refer to a judicial standard of proof, e.g.,
substantial evidence. This flows from the fact that impeachment is “not the means intended
to redress and punish offenses against the state, but rather a mere political safeguard designed
to preserve the state and its system of laws from internal harm.” [In re: Letter of Mrs. Corona,
supra].

Even  if  impeachment  is  political  in  character, non-compliance  with  requirements  in  the
Constitutional text (e.g., voting thresholds) may be subject to review by the proper court.

- What are the two stages of impeachment?

Impeachment consists of two stages: (1) Initiation, and (2) Trial.

The House of Representatives has the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment.
[Const. art. XI, § 3(1)] This process ends with the approval by at least one-third (1/3) of all the
Members of the House of Representatives of the Articles of Impeachment.

The Articles are then transmitted to the Senate, which has the sole power to try and decide all
cases of impeachment. [Const. art. XI, § 3(6)]

## B. Initiation

- What are the three ways to initiate an impeachment case?

An impeachment starts with the filing of a verified complaint (i.e., made under oath and under
pain of perjury), by any of the following:

## 3
(a) A Member of the House of Representatives;
(b) A citizen upon the endorsement by any Member of the House of Representatives; or
(c) Via a verified complaint or resolution of impeachment, filed by at least one-third (1/3)
of all Members of the House. [Const. art. XI, § 3(2)]

- How many impeachment cases can be filed against an official?

“No  impeachment  proceedings  shall  be  initiated  against  the  same  official  more  than  once
within  a  period  of  one  year.”  [Const. art.  IX,  §  3(5)] For  the  purpose  of  this  rule,  the
impeachment  proceeding  is  initiated  when  a  verified  complaint  is  filed  and  referred  to  the
Committee  on  Justice  for  action.  To “initiate”  refers  to  the  [a]  filing  of  the  impeachment
complaint  coupled  with  [b]  Congress’  taking  final  action  of  said  complaint.  [Francisco v.
House of Representatives, G.R. No. 160261 (2003)].

Following    past    congressional    practice,    multiple    impeachment    complaints    may    be
simultaneously referred to the Committee on Justice. This would count only as one initiation.
[See Gutierrez v. House of Representatives Committee on Justice, G.R. No. 193459 (2011)]

- Does  the  House  of  Representatives  need  to  conduct  hearings  before  initiating  an
impeachment case?

Generally,  the  House  of  Representatives  is  not  obligated  to  conduct  hearings  until  certain
conditions are met. First, the Committee on Justice must first find the complaint sufficient in
form and in substance. If the answer is in the affirmative, it shall give notice to the respondents
and allow them to file their Answer, affidavits, and other pleadings. Upon the receipt of all
the pleadings, the Committee shall decide if sufficient grounds for impeachment exist. If there
are sufficient grounds, only then will the Committee conduct a hearing [Rules of Procedure
in  Impeachment Proceedings (hereinafter  “House  Rules”), rule  III, 19th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.
## (2022)].

However,  if  the  House  of  Representatives  initiates  impeachment  by  direct  resolution  of  at
least  one-third (1/3) of  all  its Members,  then the House  of  Representatives  will  no  longer
conduct said  committee  hearings.  The  Articles  of  Impeachment  in  such  resolution  are
transmittable to the Senate, which must try the case “forthwith.” [Const. art. XI, § 3(5)]

- What are the “Articles of Impeachment?”

The Articles of Impeachment contain the grounds upon which the impeachable officer may
be convicted, and consequently removed from office, after the trial held at the Senate. They
are prepared by the House of Representatives after the conduct of hearings in the Committee
on Justice [House Rules, rule III, § 9], or are equivalent to the verified complaint/resolution
of at least one-third (1/3) of all the Members of the House [House Rules, rule IV, § 14].

- What happens if the official is “impeached?” How is different from “convicted?”

Formally, if an official is “impeached,” Congress has found sufficient grounds to charge her
so that she may be tried in the Senate.

Meanwhile, an impeached official is “convicted” (or acquitted) if at least two-thirds (2/3) of
all the Members of the Senate find her guilty (or not guilty) of the charges filed by the House
of  Representatives. Once  convicted,  the  respondent  is  removed  from  public  office and  the
Senate has the discretion to impose the additional penalty of permanent disqualification from
holding any and all further public office [In re: Letter of Mrs. Corona, supra].

## C. Trial

- What happens in an impeachment trial?

In  an  impeachment  trial,  the  Senate  tries  the  impeached  officer  under  the  Articles  of
Impeachment transmitted to it by the House of Representatives.

Briefly and pursuant to the current Senate Rules of Procedure on Impeachment Trials [S. Res.
39,  19th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.  (2023)  [hereinafter  “Senate  Rules”]], senators  are first sworn to
“political neutrality,” i.e., to exercise their duty without unfair discrimination and regardless
of party affiliation or preference. [Senate Rules, rule III]

The  impeached  official  is then called  to  answer  (or  plead)  to  each  charge  in  the  Articles  of
Impeachment. She may appear in person or send a representative or counsel to plead for her,
unlike in a criminal case. If she refuses to appear or plead, the Senate will continue with trial
as if she pleaded “not guilty.” [Senate Rules, rules VII & IX]

The Senate then hears arguments and witnesses from both the prosecution and the defense.
Unlike in court proceedings where a judge asks questions sparingly, Senators may in practice
ask extensively not just a witness but also counsel for either side. There is no requirement for
the  impeached  official  to  appear  as  a  witness  for  himself. After  closing  arguments, trial  is
concluded  and  the  Senate  votes. At  least  two-thirds  (2/3)  of  all  the  Members  of  the  Senate
must vote for conviction on any of the Articles of Impeachment for the impeached official to
be convicted.

- Who serve as counsel in the impeachment trial?

As  the House  of  Representatives  is the  body  that  accuses  the  impeached  official,  it  is
represented by a panel of prosecutors who are selected from the House’s own Members. They
may  be  assisted  by  private lawyers,  who can  also  examine  witnesses  but  who are always
under  the  direct  control  and  supervision  of  the  panel  of  prosecutors  (or  “managers”  in
American law).

The impeached official shall be represented by her own counsel. [See Senate Rules, rule XIII]

- Does the impeached official continue to hold public office during the Senate trial?

Yes. Pending the decision of the Senate on the impeachment complaint, the official impeached
by the House of Representatives will continue to hold and exercise the functions of her office.
The Constitution does not provide for a preventive suspension, unlike what statutes provide
in other administrative cases.

- How long does an impeachment trial last?

There is no fixed time for an impeachment trial. In the past, trial ranged from around one (1)
month  during  the  Estrada  impeachment trial (2000-2001),  and  five  (5)  months  during  the
Corona  impeachment trial (2012).  Notably,  the  Estrada  impeachment  was pre-terminated
after EDSA II, when the Senate adjourned without voting after President Estrada resigned.

- Must the Senate conduct trial in public (e.g., televised or livestreamed)?

Yes. While the Senate is sitting upon an impeachment trial, its doors shall remain open to the
public. [Senate Rules, rule XVIII] Historically, every impeachment trial has been televised and
covered extensively by the media due to the exceptional character of the proceeding.

- Does the Senate have to hear all charges first before voting? Does the Senate have
to vote on all charges at the same time?

Under  the  rules  of  the  19th  Congress,  “trial  of  all  the  articles  of  impeachment  shall  be
completed before the Senators vote on the final question on whether or not the impeachment
is sustained.” [Senate Rules, rule XXI]

After trial is finished, each Article is voted upon by the Members of the Senate separately. To
result in conviction, it is enough that at least two-thirds (2/3) of all the Members of the Senate
vote guilty on one Article. However, if not a single Article received the required number of
votes, the impeached official is acquitted.

Note  that  this  rule  is  similar  to  the  Senate  Rules  during  the  15th  Congress  and  the  Corona
impeachment trial (2012). In that case, the House Prosecution dropped five (5) of the eight (8)
Articles of Impeachment, allowing the Senate to terminate trial early and vote only on three
(3) charges.

- What happens if the official is convicted?

Judgment consists of (a) removal and (b) disqualification to hold any office in government.
[Const. art. XI, § 3(7)]. An impeachment conviction cannot be pardoned. [Const. art. VII, § 19]

Previously,  there  has  been  debate  on  whether  the  Senate  can  impose  a  lower  penalty  than
removal.  The  records  of  the  Constitutional  Commission  suggest  that  no  penalty  other than
removal  and  disqualification  was  contemplated.  [See Rec.  Const.  Comm’n  No.  40  (July  26,
1986); No. 41 (July 28, 1986)]

In  any  event,  the  impeached  official can  be  held  criminally  and/or  civilly  liable  after her
removal by filing the proper charges with the courts of law. Prosecution after impeachment
does not constitute prohibited double jeopardy. [In re: Letter of Mrs. Corona, supra]

- What happens if the official is acquitted?

The acquittal of the official does not bar the initiation of subsequent impeachment proceeding
against the acquitted official, subject to the one-year bar rule discussed above. [See Const. art.
## XI, § 3(5)]

- What  happens  when  an  official  resigns  after she  is  impeached  but  before she  is
convicted?

The practice has been for Senate not to proceed to trial or, if trial has begun, to pre-terminate
it.  In  the  case  of  Ombudsman  Merceditas  Gutierrez  and COMELEC  Chairman  Andres
Bautista,   the   Senate   did   not   take   further   action   after   they   resigned   following   their
impeachment  by  the  House  of  Representatives.  In  the  case  of  President  Joseph  Estrada, his
impeachment trial was terminated by the Senate after his resignation following EDSA II.

There  is  a  view  that trial may  proceed  even  after  the  termination or  resignation of the
impeached  officer  because  the  consequence  of  impeachment  is  not  only  removal, but also
disqualification and fitness to hold future public office.

- Is the Senate required to release a written decision?

No. While  Article  VIII,  Section  14  of  the  Constitution  requires judicial courts  to  render  a
decision stating therein the facts and law which it is based on, the same is not required for the
Senate sitting as an impeachment court.

Senators  vote  on  each  article  of  impeachment  after  the  presiding  officer  calls  his  name,  to
which the senator shall rise and answer guilty or not guilty. It is only when such Senator wishes
that she may explain her vote for not more than two (2) minutes. When two-thirds (2/3) of
the Senate  vote guilty  upon  any  article  of  impeachment,  a  judgment  of  conviction  is
pronounced, and a certified copy thereof is deposited in the Office of the Secretary of Senate.
[Senate Rules, rule XXI]

In practice, senators may write an extended opinion (as in the case of former Senate President
Juan Ponce Enrile, during the Corona impeachment (2012)). However, such opinion does not
have any legal effect or persuasive weight in future impeachments as the official act is simply
the vote of the Senate.

- May the impeached official file a motion for reconsideration or appeal?

Motions  for  reconsideration  of  a  judgment  of  conviction  are  prohibited  (“not  in  order”).
[Senate  Rules,  rule  XXI] As  the  political  act  of  a  coordinate  branch,  the Senate’s decision  to
convict or acquit cannot be appealed to the courts.

## D. Judicial Intervention

- Can the Supreme Court intervene in impeachment cases?

Yes. The Supreme Court has the power to “determine whether or not there has been a grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or
instrumentality   of   the   Government.”   [Const.   Art.   VIII,   §   1] In Francisco   v. House   of
Representatives, supra, the  Court  stated  that  impeachment  cases  are  not  truly  political
questions. The  Supreme  Court  has  thus  intervened  in  past  impeachment  cases  when  the
sparse limits provided by the Constitution were alleged to have been violated.

- Which matters can the Supreme Court review?

The Court’s power of judicial review extends over justiciable issues arising in impeachment
proceedings, such as compliance with the impeachment procedure in the Constitution (e.g.,
the one-year bar rule). [Francisco v. House of Representatives, supra] There is nevertheless a
view  that whether  or  not  Senate  Impeachment  Rules  were  followed  is  a  political  question
belonging  to  the  Senate. [Corona  v.  Senate,  G.R.  No.  200242  (2012),  citing  the  Senate’s
arguments]

- Can the Supreme Court reverse an impeachment or a conviction?

No. While there are reviewable aspects of an impeachment proceeding as discussed above,
the decision of the House of Representatives to impeach and the judgment of the Senate to
convict or  acquit, and  the respective  reasons therefor, are  not  reviewable  by  the  Supreme
## Court.

Article  IX  of  the  Constitution  provides  that  the “exclusive power” to  initiate  impeachment
cases belongs to the House of Representatives and the “sole power” to try and decide them
lies with the Senate. As these provisions are a “textually demonstrable commitment” by the
Constitution  to  these  bodies, and  there  are  no  constitutionally  imposed  limits  on  this
discretion, the decision to impeach and convict or acquit remain truly political questions. [See
Francisco v. House of Representatives, supra]

E. Novel and Miscellaneous Questions

- If  the  Vice-President  is convicted  and  removed,  how  will  her  replacement  be
chosen?

The  President  shall  nominate  a  Vice-President  from  among  the  Members  of  the  Senate  and
the  House  of  Representatives.  If  majority  of  all  the  Members  of  both  Houses  of  Congress,
voting separately, confirm the nominee, she shall become the Vice-President. [Const. art. VII,
§  9] The  congressional  seat  vacated  by  the  new  Vice-President  may  be  filled  by  a  special
election. [Const. art. VI, § 9]

- What  happens  if  the  impeachment  trial  is  not  terminated  at  the  end  of  the  19th
Congress?  Can  official  be  impeached  and  convicted  by  different  Congresses, e.g.,
the  House  of  Representatives  of  the  19th  Congress  and  the  Senate  of  the  20th
## Congress?

There are two views. One view is that the Senate can continue with trial beyond June 30, 2025
because  it  is  a  “continuing  body” pursuant  to  older  decisions  of  the  Supreme  Court [see
Arnault v. Nazareno, G.R. No. L-3820 (1950)]; the power of impeachment is not legislative and
therefore does not expire with each Congress; and accountability as the underlying spirit of
the Constitution requires a final decision by the Senate.

The  other  view  is  that the Supreme Court  has more  recently held  the  Senate not  to  be  a
continuing  body.  Hence, “due  to  the  termination  of  the  business  of  the  Senate  during  the
expiration of one (1) Congress, all pending matters and proceedings, such as unpassed bills
and  even  legislative  investigations,  of  the  Senate  are  considered  terminated  upon  the
expiration of that Congress and it is merely optional on the Senate of the succeeding Congress
to  take  up  such  unfinished  matters,  not  in  the  same  status,  but  as  if  presented  for  the  first
time.” [Balag v. Senate, G.R. No. 234608 (2018)]

- May the Senate try an impeachment case even if it has previously adjourned, i.e., in
legislative recess?

There are also two views. One view is that the Senate can only conduct the impeachment trial
when  it  is  in  session.  This  would  be  consistent  with  the practice  during  the Estrada
impeachment  trial  (2000-2001) and  Corona impeachment  trial  (2012),  where  sittings  were
suspended while the Senate was in recess. If this were the case, the Senate can only conduct
the  impeachment  trial  of  Vice-President  Sara  Duterte  when  it  resumes  session  after June  2,
2025, unless it is called into a special session by the President pursuant to Article VI, Section
15 of the Constitution.

The  other  view is  that  the  Senate  can  and  should  hold  trial  immediately  and  even  when
Congress is not in session. Article IX, Section 3(4) of the Constitution—the mode used by the
House of Representatives to impeach Vice-President Duterte—directs that “trial by the Senate
shall  proceed forthwith,”  a  word  that  the  Constitution  uses  in  other  provisions  to mean
without  delay. Further,  “sessions”  in  the  Constitution  are  legislative  in  character,  and in
practice, non-legislative or preparatory work continues even when Congress is adjourned. In
that light, impeachment is not a legislative function and the power to try impeachment cases
can be exercised even when session is suspended.

Notably,  the current  penultimate  adjournment of  the 3rd  Session  of  the  19th  Congress  is
longer than those of the 3rd Sessions of the 17th and 18th Congress.
