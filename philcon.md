## PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION
## A. THE CONSTITUTION
Constitution – a written instrument enacted by direct action of the people by which the fundamental
powers  of  the  government  are  established,  limited  and  defined,  and  by  which  those  powers  are
distributed among the several departments for their safe and useful exercise for the benefit of the body
politic. (Justice Malcolm)
- It is the study of the maintenance of the proper balance between authority as represented by
the  three  inherent  powers  of  the  State  and  liberty  as  guaranteed  by  the  Bill  of  Rights. (Cruz,
## Constitutional Law 1)
- It  is  a  body  of  rules  and  maxims  in  accordance  with  which  the  powers  of  sovereignty  are
habitually exercised. (Cooley)
## Purposes:
- to prescribe the permanent framework of a system of government;
- to assign to the several departments powers and duties;
- to establish certain first fixed principles on which government if founded.
## Nature:
- Supremacy of the Constitution
It is the basic and paramount law to which all other laws must conform and to which all persons,
including the highest officials of the land, must defer.
- The symbol of monument of the people’s will. It may be submitted for ratification of the people.
- It outlines the infrastructure of the government.
- It must be obeyed by all.
- The courts are the ultimate guardian of the Constitution.
## Concept:
Our Constitution is written, conventional and rigid. Its precepts are embodied in one document.
It was formally ‘struck off’ at a definite time and place following a conscious or deliberate effort taken by
a constituent body. And it is one that can be amended only by a formal and usually difficult process.
(Cruz, Constitutional Law 1)
The real and main function of 1987 Constitution is to replace the Freedom Constitution, which
was revolutionary constitution and to pave the way for stability and normality under regular Constitution
approved by people.
Effectivity  of  the  1987  Constitution- February  2,  1987,  the  date  of  the  plebiscite  when  the  people
ratified the Constitution (De Leon vs. Esguera, 153 SCRA 602).

Amendments and Revisions
Amendment – means isolated or piecemeal change only.
## Purposes:
- to improve specific parts
- to add new provisions deemed necessary to meet new conditions
- to suppress specific portions that may have become obsolete or that are judged to be dangerous.
Revision- is a revamp or rewriting of the whole instrument.
## Purposes:
-  re-examination of the entire document
- re-examination of provisions of document which have over-all implications for the entire document,
to determine how and to what extent they should be altered. (Bernas, Political Law I)
Revolution- if the change made dehors the constitution is made by the sovereign people, the resultant
alteration  is  not  unconstitutional  but  extra-constitutional.  This  is  important  because  of  the  manner  in
which the 1973 Constitution and the Freedom Constitution of 1986 came into being. (Justice Antonio in
Ratification cases)
The  amendatory and revision provisions are called “constitution  of  sovereignty” because it is
through these provisions that the sovereign people have allowed the expression of their sovereign will
through  this  constitution  to  be  canalized.  It  defines  the  constitutional  meaning  of  sovereignty  of  the
people.
Two-Part Test
- Quantitative test- whether the proposed change is so extensive in its provision as to change directly
the “substance entirety” of the Constitution by the deletion or alteration of numerous provisions.
- Qualitative test- inquires into the qualitative effects of the proposed change in the Constitution. The
main inquiry is whether the change will “accomplish such far –reaching changes in the nature of our
basic governmental plan as to amount to a revision.”(Lambinovs. Comelec, Oct. 25, 2006)
Stages/ Steps in the Amendatory and Revision process:
Proposal Stage and Ratification Stage
## I. Proposal Stage
- Proposal for Amendments
3 methods:
a.  by  Congress  upon  a  vote  of  ¾  of  all  its  members. (Congress  here  acts  as  a  constituent
assembly)

## 3
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

b. by constitutional convention
c.  by  the  people  through  initiative  upon  a  petition  of  at  least  12%  of  the  total  number  of
registered  voters,  of  which  every  legislative  district  must  be  represented  by  at  least  3%  of
registered voters therein.
## Limitations:
- Amendment through people’s initiative shall not be authorized  within  5  years  following  the
ratification of 1987 Constitution.
-  Amendment through people’s initiative shall not be oftener than once every 5 years. (Sec. 2,
Art. XVII)
## Requirements:
- there must be written petition
- the petitioners must be at least 12% of the total number of registered voters
3 of the 12% total number of registered voters, every legislative district must be represented by
at least 3% of registered voters therein.
## Procedure:
- The people must author and sign the entire proposal; no agent or representative can sign in
their behalf;
- As an initiative upon a petition, the proposal must be embodied in the petition.
*Failure  to  comply  with  these  requirements  was  fatal  to  the  validity  of  the  initiative  petition.
(Lambino vs, Comelec, Oct. 25, 2006)
Proposal through people’s initiative applies only to amendments, not to revision.
Sec. 2, Art. XVII is not a self-executing provision; the Congress shall enact an implementing law.
And so R.A. 6735 was enacted as the implementing law of Sec. 2, Art XVII. Under R.A. 6735, there are
three initiatives:
- initiative on the Constitution- refers to  a petition proposing amendments to the Constitution
- initiative on statutes- refers to a petition to enact a national legislation
-  initiative on local legislation- refers to a petition proposing to enact a regional, provincial, city
or municipal or barangay law, resolution or ordinance.
*Proposal for Revision
2 methods:
a.  by  Congress  upon  a  vote  of  ¾  of  all  its  members. (Congress  here  acts  as  a  constituent
assembly)

## 4
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

b. by Constitutional Convention
If  the  Congress  chooses  to  call  a  constitutional  convention  to  revise  the  Constitution,  it  may
either:
a. call a constitutional convention by a vote of 2/3 of all its Members; or
b. submit to the electorate the question of calling such a convention by a majority vote of all its
members. (Sec. 3, Art XVII)
The   choice   of   the   method   of   proposal   is   discretionary   upon   the   legislature (Occeňa
vs.COMELEC)
Since the Constitution is silent about the method and since the amendatory process has been
committed  to  Congress, under  the “political questions doctrine” Congress  should  be  free  to  choose
whichever method it prefers:
- Each House may separately formulate amendments by a vote of ¾ of all its members, and
then  pass  it  on  to  the  other  house  for  similar  process.  Disagreements  can  be  settled  through  a
conference committee.
- Congress may also decide to come together in joint session and vote separately on proposed
amendments and revisions.
What  is  essential  is  that  both  Houses  vote  separately,  because  the  power  to  propose
amendments is given to a bicameral body.             (Bernas, Political Law I)
When the Congress directly proposed the amendment or revesion, it is acting in its constituent
assembly and not as legislative body.
The Constitutional Commission is a separate and distinct body from Congress. (Prof. Sandoval,
## UP BRI)
The case of Frantz vs. Autry declares that as long as the Constitutional Commission exists and
confines itself within the sphere of its jurisdiction, it must be considered independent of and co-equal
with other department of the government.
II. Ratification
It involves the people themselves in their sovereign act of drafting or altering the fundamental
law. It is imperative and proper that approval came directly from the people. (Cruz, Constitutional Law1)
Amendment or revision shall be valid when ratified by majority of vote cast in a plebiscite held
not earlier than 60 days nor later than 90 days after approval by Congress or constitutional convention.
(par. 1, Sec. 4, Art. XVII)
If the amendment is through people’s initiative,  it  shall  be  valid  if  ratified  by  a  majority  of  the
votes cast in a plebiscite which shall be held not earlier than sixty days nor later than ninety days after
the certification by the COMELEC of the sufficiency of the petition. (par. 2, Sec. 4, Art. XVII)
In Gonzales vs. COMELEC, SC sustained the simultaneous holding of regular election and the
plebiscite.

REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

Judicial review of Amendments
The question of the validity of the adoption of amendments to the Constitution is now subject to
judicial review. It allows the courts to inquire into whether or not the prescribe procedure for amendment
has been observed.
In Sanidad  v.  COMELEC  (73  SCRA  333), SC  ruled  that  the  amending  process  both  as  to
proposal and ratification raises a judicial question. The SC has the last word in the construction not only
of treaties and statutes, but also of the constitution itself.
The amending power, like all other powers organized in the Constitution is in form a delegated
and hence a limited power, so that the SC is vested with that authority to determine whether the power
has been discharged within its limits.
Thus,  the  judiciary  may  declare  invalid  a  proposal  adopted  by  less  than  ¾  of  members  of
Congress, o a call for constitutional convention by less than 2/3 of legislature, or a ratification made by
less than majority votes cast, or a plebiscite irregularly held.
- Self-Executing and Non-Self-Executing Provisions
Self-executing provision- is a rule that by itself is directly or indirectly applicable without need of
statutory implementation.
Example: provisions found in the Bill of Rights which may be invoked by proper parties independently
of or even against legislative enactment.
Non-self-executing  provision- is  one  that  remains  dormant  unless  it  is  activated by  legislative
implementation.
Example: Art. II, Sec. 4 states that ‘all citizens may be required under conditions provided by law to
render personal military or civil service’. Such requirement cannot be imposed until and unless the
legislature so wills, through the passage of law specifying the conditions.
Another example of non-self-executing provision is par.2, Section 2, Art XVII, which states that
“The Congress shall provide for the implementation of the exercise of this right.”
In  the  case  of Santiago  vs.  Commision, an attempt to use ‘people’s initiative as method of
proposal was stuck down by SC for lack of necessary implementing law. The provision was not self-
executing and RA 6735 provides for local initiative only not the national.
## 5. General Provisions
## ARTICLE XVI
Section 1. The flag of the Philippines shall be red, white, and blue, with a sun and three stars, as
consecrated and honored by the people and recognized by law.
Section 2. The Congress may, by law, adopt a new name for the country, a national anthem, or
a  national  seal,  which  shall  all  be  truly reflective  and  symbolic  of  the  ideals,  history,  and
traditions of the people. Such law shall take effect only upon its ratification by the people in a
national referendum.

## 6
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

The following may be changed by law, provided it is ratified by the people:
- name of the country
- national anthem
- national seal
Thus, the law making “Bayan Ko” as the national anthem of the Philippines, in lieu of “Lupang
Hinirang” is constitutional. The Congress may by  law  adopt  a  new  national  anthem,  but  it  shall  take
effect only upon ratification by the people in a national referendum. (Handout #4, 2010 UP Law Center)
## ARTICLE I
## 1. National Territory
“The national territory comprises the Philippine archipelago, with  all  the  islands  and
waters embraced therein, and all other territories over which the Philippines has sovereignty or
jurisdiction, consisting of its terrestrial, fluvial and aerial domains, including its territorial sea,
the  seabed,  the  subsoil,  the  insular  shelves,  and  other  submarine  areas.  The  waters  around,
between,  and  connecting  the  islands  of  the  archipelago,  regardless  of  their  breadth  and
dimensions, form part of the internal waters of the Philippines.”
a. Archipelagic Doctrine
Under this  doctrine, the  Philippine  archipelago  is  considered  as  one  integral  unit  instead  of
being  fragmented  into  more  than  7,000  islands.  This  assertion,  together  with  the  application  of  the
“straight baseline method,” is what is referred to as the Archipelagic Doctrine. By using this method, the
outermost  points  of  our  archipelago  are  connected  with  straight  baselines  and  all  waters  inside  the
baselines are considered as internal waters.
Under Art. 49(1) of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, these waters do not form part of
the territorial sea but are described as archipelagic waters.
Question and Answer (2006; Bernas,4-6)
Q: What is the scope of national Territory?
A: It includes:
- the Philippine archipelago;
- all other territories over which the Philippines has sovereignty or jurisdiction;
-  the  territorial  sea,  the  seabed,  the  subsoil,  the  insular  shelves,  and  other  submarine  areas
corresponding to (1) and (2).
Moreover, (1) and (2) consists of: terrestrial, fluvial, and aerial domains.
Q: What is an archipelago?
A: An archipelago is a body of water studded with islands.

REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

Q: What exactly is the Philippine archipelago situated?
A: The Philippine archipelago is that body of water studded with islands which is delineated in the Treaty
of Paris, as modified by the Treaty of Washington and the Treaty of Great Britain. These are the same
treaties which delineated Philippine territory in Article I of the 1935 Constitution.
Q: What is included by the clause “all other territories  over  which  the  Philippines  has  sovereignty  or
jurisdiction?
A: This includes any territory which presently belongs or might in the future belong to the Philippines
through  any  of  the  internationally  accepted  modes  of  acquiring  territory.  Among  these  territories  are
what are referred to by the 1935 Constitution as “all territory over which the present (1935) Government
of the Philippine Islands exercises jurisdiction”
It also includes what was referred to under the 1973 Constitution as territories “belonging to the
Philippines  by  historic  right  or  legal  title”,  that  is,  other  territories  which,  depending  on  available
evidence, might belong to the Philippines (e.g., Sabah, the Marianas, Freedomland)
Q: By dropping the phrase “belonging to the Philippines by historic right or legal title” has not the
Constitution in effect dropped the Philippine claim to Sabah?
A: No, it has not. It has, however, avoided the use of language historically offensive to Malaysia and ha
used instead the clause “over which the Philippines has sovereignty or jurisdiction”. The clause neither
claims nor disclaims Sabah.
Q: What is the special claim made by the Philippines with respect to the “waters around, between and
connecting the islands of the archipelago?
A: The Philippines claims them as part of its “internal waters” irrespective of their breath and dimension.
This  is  one  of  the  elements  of  the  archipelagic  principles  which  is  now  recognized  by  the  1982
Convention on the Law of the Sea.
Q: What is the other element of the archipelagic principles?
A: The other element if the straight baseline method of delineating the territorial sea. This consists of
drawing straight lines connecting appropriate points on the coast without departing to any appreciable
extent  from  the  general  direction  of  the  coast.  These  baselines  divide  the  internal  waters  from  the
territorial waters of an archipelago.
## 2. State Immunity
## ARTICLE XVI
Section 3. “The State may not be sued without its consent.”
This provision is recognition of the sovereign character of the State.
Basis: Doctrine of State Immunity or Doctrine of Non- Suability is based on the logical and practical
ground that there can be no legal right against the authority which makes the law on which the right
depends. Another justification is the practical consideration that the demands and inconveniences of

## 8
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

litigation will divert the time and resources of the State from the more pressing matters demanding its
attention, to the prejudice of the public welfare. (Justice Isagani Cruz)
The Doctrine is also applicable to the following:
- This doctrine is also available to foreign states insofar as they are sought to be sued in the courts of
the local state. Following the “Principle of the Sovereign Equality of States”, one State cannot assert
jurisdiction  over  another  in  violation  of  maxim “par in parem nan habet imperium”.  To  do  so  would
“unduly vex the peace of nations”. The Head of State, who is deemed the personification of the State,
is inviolable, and thus enjoys immunity from suit.
-  The  State’s  diplomatic  agents,  including  consuls  to  a  certain  extent,  are  also  exempt  from  the
jurisdiction of local courts and administrative tribunals.
A foreign agent, operating within a territory, can be cloaked with immunity from suit but only as
long as it can be established that he is acting within the directives of the sending State. The cloak of
protection is removed the moment the foreign agent is sued in his individual capacity, as when he is
sought to be made liable for whatever damage he may have caused by hi act done with malice or in
bad faith or beyond the cope of his authority or jurisdiction.
- The UN, as well as its organs and specialized agencies, are likewise beyond the jurisdiction of local
courts.
-  It  also  applies  to  complaints  filed  against  officials  of  the  State  for  acts  performed  by  them  in  the
discharge of their duties within the scope of their authority.
However, where a public officer has committed an ultra vires act, or where there is a showing of
bad faith, malice or gross negligence, the officer can be held personally accountable even if such acts
are claimed to have been performed in connection with official duties. (Nachura, Outline Reviewer in
## Political Law)
Test to determine if suit is against the State: On the assumption that decision is rendered against
the public officer or agency impleaded, will the enforcement thereof require an affirmative act from the
State, such as the appropriation of the needed amount to satisfy the judgment? If so, then it is a suit
against the State.
There are many instances when a public officer may be sued in his official capacity without the
necessity of first obtaining the consent of the State to be sued:
- to refrain him form doing an act alleged to be unconstitutional or illegal
- to recover from him taxes unlawfully assessed or collected
Where an action is filed against a public officer for recovery only of title or possession of property
claimed to be held by him in his official capacity, the said action is not a suit against the State for which
prior waiver of immunity is required.
In the case of Festejo vs. Fernando, the action for recovery of the land or its value was properly
filed against the defendant in his personal capacity and was therefore not covered by the doctrine of
## State Immunity.

In Holy See vs. Rosario, where the plea of immunity is recognized and affirmed by the executive
branch, it is the duty of the courts to accept this claim so as not to embarrass the executive arm of the
government in conducting the country’s foreign relations.
Waiver of Immunity from Suit
This waiver is also known as the Built-in qualification of principle. Under this principle, the State
may, if it so desires, divest itself of its sovereign immunity and thereby voluntarily open itself to suit. In
fine, the State may be sued if it gives its consent.
Where no consent is shown, state immunity from suit may be invoked as a defense by the courts
sua  sponte at  any  stage  of  the  proceedings,  because  waiver  of  immunity,  being  in  derogation  of
sovereignty,  will  not  be  inferred  lightly  and  must  be  construed  in strictissimi  juris. Accordingly,  the
complaint against the State must allege the existence of such consent, otherwise, the complaint may
be dismissed. (Republic vs. Filiciano, 148 SCRA 424)
Forms of Consent:
- Express Consent- it may be manifested either through:
a. General Law, or
b. Special Law
- Implied Consent- is given when:
a. State itself commences litigation, or
b. when the State enters into a contract with private person.(only if the contract is entered into
by the gov’t in its proprietary capacity, and not gov’tal contracts)
Examples of express consent through general or special laws:
Act 3083 – is a general law whereby the Government of the Philippine Island consents and submits to
be  sued  upon  any  moneyed  claim  involving  liability  arising  from  contract,  express  or  implied,  which
could serve as a basis of civil action between private parties.
C.A. 327 as amended by P.D. 1445, provides that a claim against the government must first be filed
with the Commission on Audit, which must act upon it within 60 days. Rejection of the claim will authorize
tha claimant to elevate the matter to the SC on certiorari and in effect sue the State with its consent.
Act 2457 – is a special law enacted by Congress authorizing an individual to sue the Phil. Government
for injuries he had sustained when his motorcycle collided with a government ambulance.
A waiver of State’s Immunity from suit cannot be given by a mere lawyer. In the case of Republic
vs. Purisima (78 SCRA 470), the waiver made by the lawyer for the Rice and Corn Administration, an
agency of the government, was held by the SC as not binding upon the State.
Examples of implied consent when the State commences the litigation or enters into a contract:
Based on equitable grounds is the rule that when the State itself files a complaint, the defendant
is entitled to file a counterclaim against it. In the case of Froilan vs. Pan Oriental Shipping Co., the SC

## 10
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

held that the government impliedly allowed itself to be sued when it filed a complaint in intervention for
the purpose of asserting a claim for affirmative relief against the plaintiff to wit, recovery of a vessel.
But in the case of Lim vs. Brownell, the SC held that the government was not asking for any
affirmative relief from the plaintiff but had intervened only for the purpose of resisting his claim, the SC
held that no implied waiver of immunity could be assumed.
In Republic vs. Sandiganbayan, when the government enters into a contract, the State is then
deemed to have divested itself of the mantle of sovereign immunity and descended to the level of the
ordinary individual. Having done so, it becomes subject to judicial action and process.
According to Prof. Edwin Sandoval, the above ruling is called the ‘old rule’. There is a ‘new rule’
now applying the Restrictive Doctrine of Immunity which provides that not every contract operates as a
waiver of immunity from suit.
In  the  case  of USA  vs.  Ruiz,  suability  would  follow  only  if  the  contract  is  entered  into  by  the
government in its commercial or proprietary capacity (jure gestionis). Governmental contracts or those
entered in sovereign capacity (jus imperii) do not result in implied waiver of the immunity of the State
from suit.
When the State gives its consent to be sued, it does not thereby also consent to the execution
of the judgment against it. In the case of R.P. vs. Villasor, execution will require another waiver, lacking
which the decision cannot be enforced against the State.
Assuming the decision is rendered against the State of public officer, the enforcement thereof
will require an affirmative act from the State such as appropriation of the needed amount to satisfy the
judgment.
Public  funds  cannot  be  garnished.  It  is  against  public  policy.  There  must  be  a  corresponding
appropriation  before  a  fund  can  be  taken  out  from  the  national  treasury.  The  remedy  is  to  go  to
Congress. The Congress may enact a law appropriating public funds.
What if the Congress failed to enact an appropriation to satisfy the judgment, what will be your
remedy then? The remedy is Mandamus, but we must remember that mandamus lies only when the
act directed by mandamus is ministerial in character, and to enact an appropriation is discretionary on
the  part  of  the  Congress.  However,  in  the  case  of Mun.  of  Makati  vs. CA,  the  SC  sustained  that
mandamus was the proper remedy and held that the government should be the first one to follow the
judgment of the Court. You have to know the rationale in said case. (Prof. Sandoval, UP BRI)
Acru  Jure  Imperii- the  sovereign  acts  or acts  in  governmental  capacity,  like  when  the  government
entered into a contract in pursue of a sovereign capacity, there is no waiver of immunity and no implied
consent may be derived therefrom.
Actu Jure Gestionis- it also means commercial or proprietary acts, like when the government entered
into a contract in its proprietary capacity, there is waiver of immunity, it is suable.
Test of suability of Government Agency
Kinds of Government Agency:

REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

- Incorporated agency- has a charter of its own that invests it with a separate juridical personality,
like SSS, UP, and City of Manila.
The test of its suability is found in its charter.
Rule: It is suable if its charter says so, and this is true regardless of the functions it is performing. They
are  subject to suit  even in  the  performance  of  such  functions  (governmental  or  proprietary)  because
their charter provides that they can sue and be sued. (Cruz, Constitutional Law 1)
-  Unincorporated  agency- it  has  no  separate  juridical  personality  but  is  merged  in  the general
machinery of the government, like DOJ, Bureau of Mines and Gov’t Printing Office.
Since it has no charter to be consulted to, it has no separate juridical personality. It is
necessary  to  determine  the  nature  of  the  functions  in  which  the  agency  is engaged,  so  as  to  hold  it
suable  if  they  are  proprietary  and  not suable  if  they  are  governmental.  The  test  in  every case  is the
nature of the primary functions being discharged.
In the case of Bureau of Printing vs. Bureau of Printing Employees Association, the SC held that
the non-suability of the State is available to the agency even if it is shown that it is engaged not only in
governmental functions but also, as a sideline, or incidentally, in proprietary enterprises.
When the State litigates, it is exempt from some legal requirements:
- Bond for damages or appeal bond. It is not required to put up a bond for damages or an appeal bond,
since it can be assumed that it is always solvent.
- Legal fees. It cannot be asked to pay the legal fees prescribed in the Rules of Court or the costs of
the suit.
- Interest. It is also not chargeable against the State. Exception: when it has expressly stipulated to
pay it or when interest is allowed by an act of the legislature or in eminent domain cases where damages
sustained by the owner take the form of interest at the legal rate. (Cruz, Constitutional Law1)
Municipal corporations are suable because their charters grant them the competence to sue and
be sued.
Exception: They are not liable for torts committed by them in the discharge of governmental function.
Exception  to  the  exception:  They  can  be  held  answerable  for torts  if  it  can  be  shown that they were
acting in a proprietary capacity.
In the case of COA vs. Link Worth International, Inc., (March 13, 2009), the court held that COA
is  an  unincorporated  government  agency  which does  not  enjoy  a  separate juridical  personality  of  its
own.  Hence,  even  in  the  exercise  of  proprietary  functions  incidental  to  its  primarily  governmental
functions, COA cannot be sued without its consent. Assuming that the contract it entered into with Audio
Visual can be taken as an implied consent to sued, and further that incidental relief such as damages
may  be  awarded  in  certiorari  proceedings,  Link  Worth  did  not  appeal the CA’s decision deleting the
award  of  damages  against  COA.  Consequently,  Link  Worth  is  bound  by  the  findings  of  fact  and
conclusions of law of the CA.

## Purposes:
-  to lay down the rules underlying our system of gov’t and must therefore be adhered to in the conduct
of public affairs and the resolution of the public issues.
- to emphasize and articulate more unequivocally the objectives and limitations of the governmental
action in pursuit of the general goals announced in the Preamble.
Article II (Declaration of Principles and State Policies) is a statement of general principles and
policies.  It  is  not  a  source  of  enforceable  rights. (Bases  Conversion  and  Development  Authority  vs.
## COA, 580 SCRA 295)
It is a statement of the basic ideological principles and policies that underlie the Constitution. As
such, the provisions shed light on the meaning of the other provisions of the Constitution and they are
a guide for all departments of the Government in the implementation of the Constitution.(2006Bernas,7)

## PRINCIPLES
Section  1. “The Philippines is a democratic and republican State. Sovereignty resides in the
people and all government authority emanates from them.”
Republic- is a representative government, a government run by and for the people.
Essence of Republicanism- is representation and renovation, the selection by the citizenry of a corps
of public functionaries who derive their mandate from the people and act on their behalf, serving for a
limited period only, after which they are replace or retained at the option of their principal.
The purpose of republican government is the promotion of the common welfare according to the
will  of  the  people  themselves.  The  will  is  usually  determined  by  the  rule  of  the  majority,  that  is,  the
greater number of the people. Every citizen is an individual repository of sovereignty.(Cruz, Consti. 1)
## Manifestations:
a. Our is a government of laws and not of men (Villavicencio vs. Lukban, 39 Phil. 778)
b. Rule of Majority. (Plurality in election)
c. Accountability of public officials.
d. Bill of Rights.
e. Legislature cannot pass irrepealable laws.
f. Separation of Powers.
## Purposes:
- to secure action

- to forestall overaction
- to prevent despotism
- to obtain efficiency
State- is a community of person more or less numerous, permanently occupying a definite portion of
territory, independent of external control, and possessing an organized government to which the great
body of inhabitants render habitual obedience. The four elements of the state are:
a. people- a community of persons sufficient in number and capable of maintaining the continued
existence of the community and held together by a common bond of law.
b. territory
c. sovereignty
Legal  sovereignty- supreme  power  to  affect  legal  interests  either  by  legislative,  executive  or
judicial action. This is lodged in the people but normally exercised by state agencies.
Political  sovereignty- the  sum  total  of  all  the  influences  in  a  state,  legal  and  non-legal,  which
determine the course of law.
d. government- institution or aggregate of institutions by which an independent society makes and
carries out those rules of action which are necessary to enable men to live in a social state, or which
are imposed upon the people forming that society by those who possess the power or authority of
prescribing them.(2006Bernas,9)
Section 2. “The Philippines renounces war as an instrument of national policy, adopts the
generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land and adheres to
the policy of peace, equality, justice, freedom, cooperation, and amity with all nations.”
This provision is also knows as the Doctrine of Incorporation. Every State is, by reason of its
membership  in  the  family  of  nation,  bound  by  the  generally  accepted  principles  of  international  law,
which are considered to be automatically part of its own laws.
Where there appears to be a conflict between international law and municipal law, efforts should
first  be  exerted  to  harmonize  them,  so  as  to  give  effect  to  both.  However,  where  the  conflict  is
irreconcilable  and  a  choice  has  to  be  made  between  a  rule  of  international  law  and  municipal  law,
jurisprudence dictates that municipal law should be upheld by the municipal courts. Whenever a law
was passed in the exercise of police power, it cannot be bargained away through the medium of a treaty
or a contract. (Bernas, Political Law 1)
In states where the constitution is the highest law of the land, such as RP, both statutes and
treaties may be invalidated if they are in conflict with the constitution. But in most countries, the principle
of lex posterior derogate priori applies. Under that principle, the rules of international law are given equal
standing with, and are not superior to, national legislative enactments.  (Secretary of Justice vs. Lantion,
## G.R. 139465)
It  should  be  presumed  that  municipal  law  was  enacted  with  proper  regard  for  the  generally
accepted rules of international law.

The renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy is itself a generally accepted principle
now categorically expressed in the UN Charter. The kind of war that is renounced by the Philippines is
an aggressive war, not defensive war.
Section  4.  “The  prime  duty  of  the  Government  is  to  serve  and  protect  the  people.  The
Government  may  call  upon  the  people  to  defend  the  State  and,  in  the  fulfillment  thereof,  all
citizens may be required, under conditions provided by law, to render personal, military or civil
service.”
Defense  of  the  State is  based  upon  the  inherent  right  of  every  State  to  existence  and  self-
preservation. By virtue of this right, a State may take up all necessary action, including the use of armed
force, to repel any threat to its security.
Read  also Art. XVI, Sec. 4 “the AFP shall be composed of a citizen armed force which shall
undergo military training and serve, as may be provided by law”
In People vs. Lagman and  People vs. Zosa, the accused were charged with and convicted of
refusal to register for military training as required by the statute enacted by Congress. Both claimed that
said statute was unconstitutional. The SC affirmed their conviction and uphold the constitutionality of
the statute, holding that the law in question was based on the constitutional principle particularly Art. II,
## Sec. 4.
The duty is imposed on all citizens without distinction as to gender.
In the case of Chavez vs. Romulo, The right to bear arms (P.D. 1856 as amended by R.A. 8294)
is a statutory right, not a constitutional right. Neither does it create a vested right.
The  policy  includes  the  prohibition  not  only  of  the  possession,  control,  and  manufacture  of
nuclear  weapons  but  also  nuclear  arms  tests.  Exception  to  this  policy may  be  made  by  the  political
departments; but it must be justified by the demands of the national interest. (consistent with the national
interest) But the policy does not prohibit the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
Section 6. “The separation of Church and State shall be inviolable”.
Separation of church and State was expressed in the Bill of Rights Sec. 5, Art III providing that
“no law shall be made respecting the establishment of religion of prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”
The idea is to delineate the boundaries between the 2 institutions and thus avoid encroachments
by  one  against  the  other  because  of  a  misunderstanding  of  the  limits  of  their  respective  exclusive
jurisdiction. (Cruz, Constitutional  Law1)
According to Justice Laurel, the influence of religion is deeply felt and highly appreciated by the

Section 12. “The State recognizes the sanctity of family life and shall protect and strengthen the
family as a basic autonomous social institution. It shall equally protect the life of the mother and
the life of the unborn from conception. The natural and primary right and duty of parents in the
rearing of the youth for civic efficiency and the development of moral character shall receive the
support of the Government.”
Three responsibilities of the State embodied in this section are:

## 15
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

- it shall protect and strengthen the family as a basic autonomous social institution.
- it shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception.
- The natural and primary right and duty of parents in the rearing of the youth for civic efficiency and
the development of moral character shall receive the support of the Government.
The  phrase “shall  equally  protect  the  life  of  the  mother  and  the  life  of  the  unborn  from
conception”—this will mean to suggest a policy against abortion; unborn child must be equated with the
equal protection due the mother. The provision is not closing the door on divorce, which is left for the
legislature to allow in its discretion.(Cruz, Consti.1)
Q: What is the legal meaning and purpose of the protection that is guaranteed for the unborn?
A: First, it is not an assertion that the unborm is a legal person. Second, this is not an assertion that the
life of the unborn is placed exactly on the level of the life of the mother. When necessary to save the life
of the mother, the life of the unborn may be sacrificed; but not when the purpose is merely to save the
mother from emotional suffering, for which other remedies must be sought, or to spare the child from a
life of poverty, which can be attended to by welfare institutions.(2006Bernas,16
Note: The State cannot unreasonably interfere with the exercise by parents of their natural right and
duty to rear their children, but it may regulate the same under the police power.

## ARTICLE X. LOCAL GOVERNMENT
The vitalization of LGU will:
-  enable  its  inhabitants  to  develop  their  resources  and  thereby  contribute  to  the  progress  of  whole
nation.
- they will acquire a depend sense of involvement that will encourage them to participate more actively
in direction of public affairs as members of the body politic.
In the case of Basco vs. PAGCOR, 197 SCRA 52, the SC said that local autonomy under the
1987 Constitution simply means “decentralization”, and does not make the local governments sovereign
within the State or an imperium in imperio.
Decentralization  of  administration- delegation  of  administrative  powers  to  the  LGU  in  order  to
broaden the base of governmental powers.
Decentralization of power- abdication by the national government of governmental powers.
Art. X, Sec. 5 directly conferred to the LGU the power to tax which cannot now be withdrawn by
mere statute. However, the national legislature is still the principal of LGUs, which cannot defy its will
or modify or violate it. Ours is still a unitary form of government, not a federal state. Being so, any form
of autonomy granted to local governments will  necessarily be limited and confined within the extent
allowed by the central authority. (Lina vs. Puno, Aug. 30, 2001)
The exercise of local autonomy remains subject to the power of control by Congress and the
power of general supervision by the President.

## 16
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

On the President’s power of general supervision, the President can only interfere in the affairs
and  activities  of  the  LGU  if  he  finds  that  the  latter  acted contrary  to  law.  He  cannot  interfere  in  local
affairs as long as the concerned LGU acts within the parameters of the law and the Constitution. Any
directive by the President or his alter egos seeking to alter the wisdom of a law-conforming judgment
on local affairs of the LGU is a patent nullity, because it violates the principle of local autonomy, as well
as  the  doctrine  of  separation  of  powers  of  the  executive  and  legislative  departments  in  governing
municipal corporations. (Judge Dadole vs. COA, Dec. 3, 2002)
Section 27. “The State shall maintain honesty and integrity in the public service and take positive
and effective measures against graft and corruption.”
Section  28. “Subject  to  reasonable  conditions  prescribed  by  law,  the  State  adopts  and
implements a policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest.”
Three basic principles:
- Public Office is a public trust.
- Our government is a government of laws and
not of men.
- Transparency in public service.
- Separation of Powers
Under  the Doctrine  of  Separation  of  Powers, the executive  power shall  be  vested  to  the
President of the Republic of the Philippines; the legislative power shall be vested: 1.)to the Congress
composed of Senate and the House of Representative and 2.)to the people by initiative or referendum;
and the judicial power is vested to one Supreme Court and to such lower courts as may be prescribed
by law.
In other words, separation of powers means that legislation belongs to Congress, execution to
the executive, settlement of legal controversies to the judiciary. Each is preventing from invading the
domain of the others. But the separation is not total. The system allows for “checks and balances” the
net effect of which being that, in general, no one department is able to act without the cooperation of at
least one of the other departments. (Bernas, political Law 1)
The purpose of the doctrine is intended to prevent a concentration of authority in one person or
groups of persons that might lead to an irreversible error or abuse in its exercise to the detriment of our
republican institutions. It is also intended to secure action, to forestall over-action, to prevent despotism
and obtain efficiency. (Cruz, Constitutional Law1)
3 Major Departments of the Gov’t:
- Legislative- is generally limited to the enactments of laws and may not enforce or apply them.
- Executive- is limited to the enforcement of the laws and may not enact or apply them.
- Judiciary- is limited to the application of the laws and may not enact or enforce them.

REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

Blending of Powers or Coordination of Powers- when powers are not confined exclusively within
one department but are in fact assigned to and shared by several departments.
## Examples:
- Enactment of the General Appropriations Law.
It begins with the preparation by President of the budget, which becomes the basis of the bill
adopted by the Congress and subsequently submitted by it to the President, who may then approve it.
- The Grant of Amnesty by the President requires the concurrence of the majority of all the members
of the Congress.
-  The  COMELEC  does  not  alone  deputize  law-enforcement  agencies  and  instrumentalities  of  the
government for the purpose of insuring free, orderly, honest, peaceful and credible elections but does
so with the consent of the President.
Conferment of Power:
- Expressly. The vesture of the legislative power in the Congress, the executive power in the President
and the judicial power in the Supreme Court.
## Examples:
a.  The  power  to  impeach  which  is  essentially  executive  and  the  power  to  try  and  decide
impeachment cases which is essentially judicial, are expressly lodged in the Congress, and the
power of investigation.
b. SC can exercise the executive power of removal over judges of inferior courts, although they
have been appointed by President.
c.  The  President  may  be  authorized  by  Congress  to  exercise tariff  powers  and  emergency
powers, both legislative in nature.
- Doctrine of Implication. It is based on the theory that the grant of express power carries with it all
other powers that may be reasonably inferred from it. (Angara vs. Electoral Commissin)
- Inherent or Incidental. It refers to powers which are not specifically granted by the Constitution either
expressly or by implication.
## Examples:
a.  The  President,  as  head  of  the  government  may,  independent  of  Constitution  or  statutory
authority, deport undesirable aliens as an “act of State”.
b. The Congress can punish person who impugns its integrity without proof.
c. the courts may claim that the contempt power is inherent in the judiciary.
- Checks and Balances
By means of Checks and Balances, one department is allowed to resist encroachments upon
its prerogatives or to rectify mistakes or excesses committed by the other departments. The theory is

REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

that the ends of the government are better achieved through the exercise by its agencies of only the
powers assigned to them, subject to reversal in proper case by those constitutionally authorized. (Cruz,
## Constitutional Law 1)
## Examples:
- Law making power of Congress is checked by the President through his veto power, which in turn
may be overridden by the legislature.
- The Congress may refuse to give its concurrence to an amnesty proclaimed by the President and
the Senate may also refuse concurrence to a treaty which the President has concluded.
- The President may nullify a conviction by the court in criminal case by pardoning the offender.
- The Congress may limit the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and that of inferior courts and even
abolished the latter tribunals.
- The Judiciary has the power to declare invalid an act done by the Congress, the President and his
subordinates, or the Constitutional Commission.
It is the role of the Judiciary to see to it that the constitutional distribution of powers among the
several department of the government is respected and observed.
- Delegation of Powers
Principle of Non- delegation of Powers “potestas delegate non delegari potest” what has been
delegated cannot be delegated.
It is based upon the ethical principle that such delegated power constitute not only a right but a
duty to be performed by the delegate through the instrumentality of his own judgment and not through
the intervening mind of another.                  (Cruz, Constitutional Law 1)
The  Principle  of  non- delegation  of  powers  is  applicable  to  all  the  3  major  powers  of  the
government but is especially important in the case of legislative power because of the many instances
when its delegation is permitted.
Delegation of legislative power has become the rule and its non-delegation the exception.
## Permissible Delegation
Delegation of legislative power is permitted in the following cases:
- Delegation of tariff powers to the President.
Art. VI, Sec. 28 (2). “The Congress may, by law, authorize the President to fix within specified
limits, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as it may impose, tariff rates, import and export
quotas, tonnage and wharfage dues, and other duties or imposts within the framework of the national
development program of the Government.”
The President is also granted stand-by or flexible tariff powers in Tariff and Customs Code.

## 19
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

The necessity of giving the chief executive the authority to act immediately on certain matters
affecting the national economy lest delay result in hardship of the people.
- Delegation of emergency powers to the President.
Art.  VI,  Sec.  23(2). “In times of war or other national emergency, the Congress may, by law,
authorize  the  President,  for  a  limited  period  and  subject  to  such  restrictions  as  it  may  prescribe,  to
exercise powers necessary and proper to carry out a declared national policy. Unless sooner withdrawn
by resolution of the Congress, such powers shall cease upon the next adjournment thereof.”
When  the  emergency  powers  are  delegated  to  the  President,  he  becomes  in  effect  a
constitutional dictator. But in strict legal theory, there is no total abdication of legislative authority in his
favor.
- Delegation to the people at large.
Except  in  those  cases  where,  by  the  constitution,  the  people  have  expressly  reserved  to
themselves a power of decision, the function of legislation cannot be exercised by them, even to the
extent of accepting or rejecting a law which has been framed for their consideration. The people have
voluntarily surrendered that power when they adopted the Constitution. (People vs. Vera)
- Delegation to local government.
This  traditional  exception  is  based  on  the  recognition  that  local  legislatures  are  more
knowledgeable than the national law-making body on matters of purely local concern and are therefore
in a better position to enact the necessary and appropriate legislation thereon.
The  power  of  taxation  by  the  LGU  is  derived  directly  form  the  Constitution,  subject  only  to
limitations that may be imposed by the Congress. (Art. X, Sec. 5)
- Delegation to administrative bodies.
Equivalent terms are:
Quasi- legislative power
Rule- making power
Power of subordinate legislation
What is delegated is merely the power to make and issue rules, not the power to make or pass
laws.
The power of subordinate legislation is entrusted to administrative agencies by the legislature
to:
a. implement the broad policies laid down in a statute by “filling in” the details which the Congress
may not have the opportunity or competence to provide.
b. issue contingent regulations pursuant to a delegation of authority to determine some fact or
state of things upon which the enforcement of law depends.  (Cruz vs. Youngberg)

## 20
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

The  function  performed by  the  administrative  agency  is  not  law-making but  law-execution.  In
order to ensure that the power delegated by the legislature is not law-making power, the statute
making the delegation must comply with the following tests of delegation:
## 1. Completeness Test.
The law must be complete in all its essential terms and conditions when it leaves the legislature
so that there will be nothing left for the delegate to do when it reaches him except to enforce it. (U.S.
vs. Ang Tang Ho)
## 2. Sufficient Standard Test.
It is intended to map out the boundaries of the delegate’s authority by defining the legislative
policy and indicating the circumstances under which it is to be pursued and effected.
A sufficient standard not only defines the policy fixed by the legislature but also marks its limits
by specifying the extent of the authority of the delegate as well as the conditions under which the said
policy should be implemented. (Suarez, 6
th
mos. before the bar)
The purpose is to prevent a total transference of legislative power from the law making body to
the delegate. (Ynot vs. IAC and  Pelaez vs. Auditor Genera, 15 SCRA 569l)
Since  rules  and  regulations  promulgated  by  administrative  agencies  pursuant  to  a  valid
delegating statute have the force of law, may their violation be punished as a penal statute? They may.
For an administrative regulation to have the force of penal law it is necessary:
- that such violation be made a crime by the delegating statute itself,
- that the penalty be provided by the statute itself, and
- that the regulation be published.  (Bernas, Political Law 1)
On this principle and on due process grounds, a law which prescribed a penalty “in the discretion
of the court” was declared invalid. It is not for the courts to fix the term of imprisonment where no points
of references have been provided by the legislature. (People vs. Dacuycuy, 173 SCRA 90)

- Forms of Government
The Philippines is a presidential form of government.
Presidential form of government.
Its principal identifying feature is what is called the “separation of powers.” Legislative power is given
to the Legislature whose members hold office for a fixed term; executive power is given to a separate
Executive who also holds office for a fixed term; and judicial power is held by an independent Judiciary.
The system is founded on the belief that, by establishing equilibrium among the three power holders,
harmony will result, power will not be concentrated, and thus tyranny will be avoided.
Essential characteristics of a parliamentary form of government

- the members of the government or cabinet or the executive arm are, as a rule, simultaneously
members of the legislature;
-  the  government  or  cabinet,  consisting  of  the  political  leaders  of  the  majority  party  or  of  a
coalition who are also a members of the legislature, is in effect a committee of the legislature;
- the government or cabinet has a pyramidal structure at the apex of which is the Prime minister
or his equivalent;
- the government or cabinet remains in power only for as long as it enjoys the support of the
majority of the legislature;
-  both  government  and  legislature  are  possessed  of  control  devices  with  which  each  can
demand of the other immediate political responsibility.
What constitutional forms of government have been experienced by the Philippines since 1935?
A: Presidential only. The distinguishing marks of a presidential form of government:
1) separation of powers, and
2) the pre-eminence of the President. The president was “head of state and chief executive”
Q: What is a republican state?
A:  It  is  a  state  wherein  all  government  authority  emanates  from  the  people  and  is  exercised  by
representatives chosen by the people.
Q: Why is the Philippine also called a “democratic state” by the new constitution?
A: In the view of the new Constitution, the Philippines is not only a representative or republican state
but also shares some aspects of direct democracy such as “initiative and referendum”
Government- is an agency or instrumentally through which the will of the State is formulated, expressed
and realized. The constitution requires our government to be democratic and republican.
“Doctrine of Parens Patriae” – the important task of the government is to act for the State as parens
patriae  (guardian  of  the  rights  of  people).  Under  this  doctrine,  the  State  has  the  sovereign  power  of
guardianship over persons under disability.
## Classification:
- de jure gov’t.- has rightful title but no power or control, either because this has been withdrawn from
it or because it has not yet actually into the exercise thereof.
- de facto gov’t.- gov’t of fact, that is, actually exercises power or control but without legal title.
3 kinds of de facto gov’t:
a. the gov’t that gets possession or control or, or usurps by force or by the voice of majority, the
rightful legal gov’t and maintains itself against the will of the latter.

b.  the  gov’t  that  established  as  an  independent  gov’t by  inhabitants  of  country  who  rise  in
insurrection against the parent state.
c. the gov’t that established and maintained by military forces who invade and occupy a territory of
enemy in the course of war (gov’t of paramount force)
- Presidential gov’t. –there is a separation of executive and legislative powers.
- Parliamentary gov’t.- there  is  a  fusion  of  both  executive  and  legislative  powers  in  Parliament,
although the actual exercise of executive power is vested in a Prime Minister who is chosen by, and
accountable to, Parliament.
- Unitary- a  single,  centralized  government,  exercising  powers  over  both  the  internal  and  external
affairs of the State.
- Federal- consists of autonomous state (local) government units merged into a single State, with the
national government exercising a limited degree of power over the domestic affairs but generally full
direction of the external affairs of the State.

## LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT
Legislative  power  is  not  exclusively  vested  in  Congress,  the  people  have  expressly  made  a
reservation  to  directly  enact  or  propose  laws  by  the  provision  on  initiative  and  referendum.  In  other
words, legislative power is exercised by:
- Congress which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representative; and
- People by the provision on initiative and referendum.
a. Initiative and Referendum
Local Initiative. — (a) Not  less than two thousand  (2,000)  registered  voters  in  case  of  autonomous
regions,  one  thousand  (1,000)  in  case  of  provinces  and  cities,  one  hundred  (100)  in  case  of
municipalities,  and  fifty  (50)  in  case  of  barangays,  may  file  a  petition  with  the  Regional  Assembly  or
local legislative body, respectively, proposing the adoption, enactment, repeal, or amendment, of any
law, ordinance or resolution. (Sec. 13, R.A. 6735)
Limitations on Local Initiatives. —
(a) The power of local initiative shall not be exercised more than once a year.
(b)  Initiative  shall  extend  only  to  subjects  or  matters  which  are  within  the  legal  powers  of  the  local
legislative bodies to enact.
(c) If at any time before the initiative is held, the local legislative body shall adopt in toto the proposition
presented, the initiative shall be cancelled. However, those against such action may, if they so desire,
apply for initiative in the manner herein provided. (Sec.15, R.A. 6735)

We have a bicameral congress consisting of a Senate and House of Representatives.
a. Senate
Section 2. “The Senate shall be composed of twenty-four Senators who shall be elected at large
by the qualified voters of the Philippines, as may be provided by law.”
Section 3. “No person shall be a Senator unless he is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines
and,  on  the  day  of  the  election,  is  at  least  thirty-five  years  of  age,  able  to  read  and  write,  a
registered  voter,  and  a  resident  of  the  Philippines  for  not  less  than  two  years  immediately
preceding the day of the election.”
Sec. 3 enumerates the qualifications of senator:
- natural-born citizen of the Philippines.
Natural born citizen means-
Art. IV, Section 2. Natural-born citizens are those who are citizens of the Philippines from
birth without having to perform any act to acquire or perfect their Philippine citizenship.
Those who elect Philippine citizenship in accordance with paragraph (3), Section 1 hereof
shall be deemed natural-born citizens.
- at least 35 years of age on the day of the election. The age qualification must be possessed on the
day the votes are cast as fixed by law and not on the day of proclamation. (Espinosa vs. Aquino)
- able to read and write.
- a registered voter.
- a resident of the Philippines for not less than two years immediately preceding the day of the election.
The residence requirement is satisfied if one is domiciled in the Philippines even if not physically present
in the Philippines during the two-year period.
Residence is defined as the place where one habitually resides and to which, when he is absent,
he  has  the  intention  of  returning.  In  the  case  of  senators,  residence  must  be  in  any  part  of  the
Philippines, unlike in the case of the member of HR, who must reside in the district where he is running.
The qualifications of senator under Sec. 3 are exclusive under the principle of “expressio unius
est exclusio alterius”. It is not competent for the Congress to provide by mere legislation for additional
qualifications of senator no matter how relevant they may be. (Cruz, Constitutional Law 1)
Case: Social Justice Society vs. Dangerous Drug Board, et al. (Nov. 3, 2008)

unconstitutional  as  it  imposes  a  qualification  for  candidates  for  senators  in  addition  to  those  already  provided  for  in  1987
## Constitution.
Issue: Can Congress enact a law prescribing qualifications for candidates for senator in addition to those laid down by the
## Constitution?

Held: No. Congress  cannot  enact  a  law  prescribing  qualifications  for  candidates  in  addition  to  those  laid  down  by  the
Constitution. It is basic that if the law or administrative rule violates any norm of the Constitution, that issuance is null and void
and has no effect. The Constitution is the basic law to which all laws must conform; no act must be valid if it conflicts with the
Constitution. Pimentel’s contention is well-taken. Sec. 36 (g) of RA 9165 was declared unconstitutional.
Section 4. “The term of office of the Senators shall be six years and shall commence, unless
otherwise provided by law, at noon on the thirtieth day of June next following their election. No
Senator shall serve for more than two consecutive terms. Voluntary renunciation of the office
for any length of time shall not be considered as an interruption in the continuity of his service
for the full term of which he was elected.”
Q: Does the limitation on number of elections mean that the Senator who has served two consecutive
terms must wait for 6 years before he can run again for the Senate?
A: No. A Senator could run again three (3) years after the expiration of his second term. Par. 2, Sec. 2
of Transitory Provisions provides that: “Of the Senators elected in the elections in 1992, the first twelve
obtaining the highest number of votes shall serve for six years and the remaining twelve for three years”.
Thereafter,  senatorial  elections  take  place  every  three  years  and  all  are  elected  for  a  six-year  term.
(Bernas, political Law 1)
b. House of Representatives
Section 5. (1) “The House of Representatives shall be composed of not more than two hundred
and fifty members, unless otherwise fixed by law, who shall be elected from legislative districts
apportioned among the provinces, cities, and the Metropolitan Manila area in accordance with
the number of their respective inhabitants, and on the basis of a uniform and progressive ratio,
and those who, as provided by law, shall be elected through a party-list system of registered
national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations.”
The phrase "legislative districts apportioned among the provinces, cities, and the Metropolitan
Manila area in accordance with the number of their respective inhabitants, and on the basis of a uniform
and progressive ratio" in Section 5(1) of Article VI requires that legislative districts shall be apportioned
according to proportional representation. However, this principle of proportional representation applies
only to legislative districts, not to the party-list system. The allocation of seats under the party-list system
is governed by the last phrase of Section 5(1), which states that the party-list representatives shall be
"those who, as provided by law, shall be elected through a party-list system," giving the Legislature wide
discretion in formulating the allocation of party-list seats. Clearly, there is no constitutional requirement
for   absolute   proportional   representation   in   the   allocation   of   party-list   seats   in   the   House   of
## Representatives.
(2) “The party-list  representatives  shall  constitute  twenty  per  centum  of  the  total  number  of
representatives  including  those  under  the  party  list.  For  three  consecutive  terms  after  the
ratification of this Constitution, one-half of the seats allocated to party-list representatives shall
be  filled,  as provided  by  law,  by  selection  or  election  from  the  labor,  peasant,  urban  poor,
indigenous cultural communities, women, youth, and such other sectors as may be provided by
law, except the religious sector.”
The party-list representatives shall constitute twenty per centum of the total number of
representatives including those under the party-list. x x x

REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

The   1987   Constitution   fixes   the   ratio   of   party-list   representatives   to   district
representatives.   This   ratio   automatically   applies   whenever   the   number   of   district
representatives is increased by law. The mathematical formula for determining the number of
seats available to party-list representatives is:
Number    of
seats
available
to legislative
districts
## __________
## .80
x .20 =
Number  of  seats  available  to
party-list representatives
"This formula allows for the corresponding increase in the number of seats available for
party-list representatives whenever a legislative district is created by law." Thus, for every four
district representatives,  the  1987  Constitution  mandates  that  there  shall  be  one  party-list
representative. There is no need for legislation to create an additional party-list seat whenever
four  additional  legislative  districts  are  created  by  law.  Section  5(2),  Article  VI  of  the  1987
Constitution automatically creates such additional party-list seat. (Banat vs. Comelec, July 8,
## 2009).
Section 6. “No person shall be a Member of the House of Representatives unless he is a natural-
born citizen of the Philippines and, on the day of the election, is at least twenty-five years of age,
able to read and write, and, except the party-list representatives, a registered voter in the district
in  which  he  shall  be  elected,  and  a  resident  thereof  for  a  period  of  not  less  than  one  year
immediately preceding the day of the election.”
Sec. 6 enumerates the qualifications of the member of HR:
- natural-born citizen of the Philippines.
A natural-born citizen who loses his citizenship by naturalization in another country but later is
repatriated recovers his status of being a natural-born citizen and therefore is qualified to be a member
of Congress. (Bengzon vs. Cruz)
- at least 25 years of age on the day of the election. The age qualification must be possessed on the
day the votes are cast as fixed by law and not on the day of proclamation. (Espinosa vs. Aquino)
- able to read and write.
- a registered voter in the district in which he shall be elected.
- a resident of that district for not less than one year immediately preceding the day of the election.
In Imelda Romualdez-Marcos vs. Comelec, 248 SCRA 300, the SC upheld the qualification of
Mrs.  Marcos,  despite  her  own  declaration in  her  COC  that  she  had  resided  in  the  district  for  only  7
months, because of the following:

## 26
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

- A minor follows the domicile of his parents; Tacloban became Mrs. Marcos’ domicile of origin by
operation of law when her father brought the family to Leyte;
- Domicile of origin is lost only when there is actual removal or change of domicile, a bonafide intention
of abandoning the former residence and establishing a new one, and acts which correspond with the
purpose; in the absence of clear and proof of the concurrence of all these, the domicile of origin should
be deemed to continue;
- The wife does not automatically gain the husband’s domicile because the term “residence” in Civil
law does not mean the same thing in Political Law; when Imelda married Marcos in 1954, she kept her
domicile of origin and merely gained a new home, not a domicilium necessarium;
- Even assuming that she gained a new domicile after her marriage and acquired the right to choose
a new one only after her husband died, her acts following her return to the country clearly indicate that
she chose Tacloban, her domicile of origin, as her domicile of choice.
From the foregoing reasons, two conclusions may be drawn:
1)   if a   person  retains   his   domicile  of   origin,   for   purposes   of   the   residence  requirement  for
representatives, the one year period is irrelevant because, by legal fiction, wherever he may be, he is
a resident of his domicile of origin.
2)  if  a  person  re-establishes  a  previously  abandoned  domicile  or  acquire  a  new  one,  the  one  year
requirement must be satisfied.
The  residence  requirement  was  further  clarified  in Domino  vs.  Comelec.  To  establish  a  new
domicile  of  choice,  personal  presence  in  the  place  must  be  couple  with  conduct  indicative  of  that
intention. It requires a declared and probable intent to make it one’s fixed and permanent place of
abode,  one’s  home.  To  successfully  effect  a  change  of  domicile  one  must  demonstrate  an  actual
removal  or  an  actual  change of  domicile;  a  bonafide  intention  of  abandoning  the  former  place  of
residence and establishing a new one and definite acts which correspond with the purpose. In other
words, there must basically be animus manendi coupled with animus non revertendi. The purpose to
remain in or at the domicile of choice must be for an indefinite period of time; the change of residence
must be voluntary; and the residence at the place chosen for the new domicile must be actual.

(2) Party-List System
(R.A. 7941. The Party-List System Act)
The  party-list  system  is  a  mechanism  of  proportional  representation  in  the  election  of
representatives  to  the  House  of  Representatives  from  national,  regional  and  sectoral  parties  or
organizations or coalitions thereof registered with the Comelec.
## Nature:
The  party-list  system  is  a  social  justice  tool  designed  not  only  to  give  more  law  to  the  great
masses of our people who have less in life, but also to enable them to become veritable lawmakers
themselves, empowered to participate directly in the enactment of laws designed to benefit them.

## 27
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

The  party-list  system  is  not  a  proportional  system  of  representation  designed  to  strengthen
democracy but as ‘sectoral representation” meant to promote social justice.(Ang Bagong Bayani, et. al
vs. Comelec, June 26, 2001)
Those  qualified  to  participate  in  the  party-list system are “registered national, regional, and
sectoral parties or organizations” in the manner explained by Commissioner Monsod. The party-list
representative will constitute “twenty per centum of the total number of representatives including those
under the party list.” Thus for instance, under a total membership of 250, a fully operative party-list
system  would  mean  200  district  representatives  and  50  party-list  representatives.  (Bernas,  Political
## Law 1)
Qualifications of Party-list nominees:
- natural-born citizen of the Philippines.
- at least 25 years of age on the day of the election. For youth sector, he must be 25 years of age but
not more than 30 years of age on th day of election. Any youth representative who attains the age of 30
during his term shall be allowed to continue in office until the expiration of his term.
- able to read and write.
- a registered voter.
- a resident of the Philippines for at least one year immediately preceding the day of the election.
-  a  bonafide  member  of  the  party  or  organization  which  he  seeks  to  represent  for  at  least  90  days
preceding the day of the election, and is at least 25 years of age on the day of the election.
R.A.  7941,  Section  10. Manner  of  Voting.  Every  voter  shall  be  entitled  to  two (2)
votes: the first is a vote for candidate for member of the House of Representatives in his
legislative  district,  and  the  second,  a  vote  for  the  party,  organizations,  or  coalition  he
wants represented in the house of Representatives: Provided, That a vote cast for a party,
sectoral  organization,  or  coalition  not  entitled  to  be  voted  for  shall  not  be  counted:
Provided, finally, That the first election under the party-list system shall be held in May
## 1998.
Q: How many votes must an organization receive in order to qualify for a seat in the House?
A: At least 2% of the total votes cast for the party-list system in order to be entitled to a party-list seat.
Those  garnering  more  than  this  percentage  may  have “additional  seats  in  proportion  to  their  total
number of votes.” Furthermore, no winning party, organization or coalition may have more than three
seats in the HR. (Bernas, Political Law 1)
In Veterans  Federation  Party  vs.  Comelec,  the  SC  said  that  the  Constitution  and  R.A.  7941
mandate at least four (4) inviolable parameters:
1.) the 20% allocation: the combined number of all party-list congressmen shall not exceed 20% of the
total membership of the HR;
2.) the 2% threshold: only those parties garnering a minimum of 2% of the total valid votes cast for the
party-list system are qualified to have a seat in the House;

## 28
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

3.) the three-seat limit: each qualified party, regardless of the number of votes it actually obtained, is
entitled to a maximum of three seats, i.e., one qualifying and two additional.
4.) proportional  representation:  the  additional  seats  which  a  qualified  party  is  entitled  to  shall  be
computed “in proportion to their total number of votes”.
The 20% allocation of the total House membership is merely a ceiling. It was merely a maximum
limit to the number of party-list representatives but the maximum need not be filled, or it is not mandatory
to fill it out all the time.
The filling-up of all available party-list seats is not mandatory. Actual occupancy of the party-list
seats depends on the number of participants in the party-list election. If only ten parties participated in
the 2007 party-list election, then, despite the availability of 54 seats, the maximum possible number of
occupied party-list seats would only be 30 because of the three-seat cap. In such a case, the three-seat
cap prevents the mandatory allocation of all the 54 available seats. (Banat vs. Comelec)
In the  case  of Banat  vs.  Comelec,  July  8, 2009, the  SC  established the four  parameters  in  a
Philippine-style party-list election system:
-  Twenty  percent  of  the  total  number  of  the  membership  of  the  House  of  Representatives  is  the
maximum  number  of  seats  available  to  party-list  organizations,  such  that  there  is  automatically  one
party-list seat for every four existing legislative districts.
-  Garnering  two  percent  of  the  total  votes  cast  in  the  party-list  elections  guarantees  a  party-list
organization one seat. The guaranteed seats shall be distributed in a first round of seat allocation to
parties receiving at least two percent of the total party-list votes.
- The additional seats, that is, the remaining seats after allocation of the guaranteed seats, shall be
distributed to the party-list organizations including those that received less than two percent of the total
votes.  The  continued  operation  of  the  two  percent  threshold  as  it  applies  to  the  allocation  of  the
additional seats is now unconstitutional because this threshold mathematically and physically prevents
the filling up of the available party-list seats. The additional seats shall be distributed to the parties in a
second round of seat allocation according to the two-step procedure laid down in the Decision of 21
April 2009 as clarified in this Resolution.
- The three-seat cap is constitutional. The three-seat cap is intended by the Legislature to prevent any
party from dominating the party-list system. There is no violation of the Constitution because the 1987
Constitution does not require absolute proportionality for the party-list system. The well-settled rule is
that courts will not question the wisdom of the Legislature as long as it is not violative of the Constitution.
These  four  parameters  allow  the  mathematical  and  practical  fulfillment  of  the  Constitutional
provision that party-list representatives shall comprise twenty percent of the members of the House of
Representatives. At the same time, these four parameters uphold as much as possible the Party-List
Act, striking down only that provision of the Party-List Act that could not be reconciled anymore with the
## 1987 Constitution.
Note: In the previous case of Labo v. COMELEC, this Court ruled that the votes cast for an ineligible or
disqualified candidate cannot be considered "stray" except when the electorate is fully aware in fact and
in law of a candidate's disqualification so as to bring such awareness within the realm of notoriety but
nonetheless cast their votes in favor of the ineligible candidate. In its Resolution dated June 25, 2003,

## 29
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

the Court held that the Labo doctrine cannot be applied to the party-list system in view of Sec. 10 of
R.A.  No.  7941  which  expressly  provides  that  the  votes  cast  for  a  party,  a  sectoral  organization  or  a
coalition "not entitled to be voted for shall not be counted." (Prof. Sandoval, UP Law Center)
- Legislative Privileges, Inhibitions and Disqualifications
## Privileges:
Section  11. “A  Senator  or  Member  of  the  House  of  Representatives  shall,  in  all  offenses
punishable  by  not  more  than  six years  imprisonment,  be  privileged  from  arrest  while  the
Congress is in session. No Member shall be questioned nor be held liable in any other place for
any speech or debate in the Congress or in any committee thereof.”
The phrase “while the Congress is in session” does not refer to the day-to-day meetings
of  the  legislature  but  to  the  entire  period  from  its  initial  convening  until  its  final  adjournment. (Cruz,
## Constitutional Law 1)
The provision speaks of two parliamentary immunities:
- Immunity/Privilege from Arrest.
This is intended to ensure representation of the constituents of the member of the Congress by
preventing attempts to keep him from attending its sessions. (Justice Isagani Cruz).
Two (2) requirements:
a.) the offense is punishable by less than six years;
b.) while the Congress is in session.
This  is  reinforced  by  Art.  145  of  RPC: Article  145.  Violation  of  parliamentary  immunity. - The
penalty of prision mayor shall be imposed upon any person who shall use force, intimidation, threats,
or fraud to prevent any member of the National Assembly (Congress of the Philippines) from attending
the meetings of the Assembly (Congress) or of any of its committees or subcommittees, constitutional
commissions or committees or divisions thereof, from expressing his opinions or casting his vote; and
the penalty of prision correccional shall be imposed upon any public officer or employee who shall, while
the Assembly (Congress) is in regular or special session, arrest or search any member thereof, except
in case  such  member  has  committed  a  crime  punishable  under  this  Code  by  a  penalty  higher  than
prision mayor. (As amended by Com. Act No. 264.)
Immunity from arrest is not enjoyed by one who has been convicted. Thus a Congressman who
has been convicted of rape and is in detention cannot claim that he should be freed because of popular
sovereignty and the need of his constituents to be represented.
In the case of Trillanes vs. Judge Pimentel, June 27, 2008, in denying the petitioner’s Motion
for Leave to attend Senate sessions and to attend to his official function as Senator, the SC ruled that
Sec. 13, Art. III of the Constitution explicitly provides that crimes punishable by reclusion perpetua are
non-bailable. The SC further said that the presumption of innocence does not necessarily carry with it
the full enjoyment of civil and political rights.

Its  purpose  is to  enable and  encourage  a representative  of  the  public  to discharge  his  public
trust with firmness and success for it is indispensably necessary that he should enjoy the fullest liberty
of  speech,  and  that  he  should  be  protected  from  the resentment  of  every  one,  however  powerful,  to
whom the exercise of that liberty may occasion offense. (Osmeña, Jr. vs Penadatun, 109Phil863)
It  enables  the  legislature  to  express  views  bearing  upon  the  public  interest  without  fear  of
accountability outside the halls of the legislature for his inability to support his statements with the usual
evidence required in the court of justice.
Two (2) requirements:
a.) the remark must be made while the legislature or the legislative committee is functioning, that is in
session;
b.) they must be made in connection with the discharge of official duties. (Justice Isagani Cruz)
Note however that the member of Congress may be called to account for his remarks or for such
speech  or  debate  by  his  own  colleagues  in  the  Congress  itself  and,  when  warranted,  punished  for
disorderly behavior. (par. 3, Sec.16, Art. VI)
In  the  case  of Jimenez  vs.  Cabangbang,  17  SCRA  876, the  expression  refers  to  utterances
made  by  Congressman  in  the  performance  of  their  official  functions,  such  as  speeches  delivered,
statements made, or votes cast in the halls of Congress, while the same is in session, as well as bills
introduced  in  Congress,  whether  the  same  is  in  session  or  not,  and  other  acts  performed  by
Congressman, either in Congress or outside the premises housing its offices, in the official discharge
of their duties as members of Congress and of Congressional Committees duly authorized to perform
its functions as such, at the time of the performance of the acts in question.

Case: (Osamena, Jr. vs Penadatun, 109Phil863)
Facts: Congressman  Osmeña,  in  a  privilege  speech  delivered  before  the  House,  made  the  serious
imputations of bribery against the President and that he refused to produce before the House Committee
created for the purpose. He was, by resolution of the House, suspended from office for a period of 15
months for serious disorderly behaviour. He filed a verified petition and asked for annulment of such
Resolution on the ground of infringement of his parliamentary immunity.
Issue: Whether said Resolution violated his constitutional absolute parliamentary immunity for speeches
delivered in the House?
Held: No.  Sec.  11,  Art.  VI,  guarantees  the  legislator  complete  freedom  of  expression  without  fear  of
being made responsible in criminal or civil actions before the courts or any other forum outside of the
Congressional  Hall. But  it  does  not  protect  him  from  responsibility  before  the  legislative  body  itself
whenever  his  words  and  conduct  are  considered  by  the  latter  disorderly  or  unbecoming  a  member
thereof. It has always been understood to mean that although exempt from prosecution or civil actions
for  their  words  uttered  in  Congress,  the  members  of  Congress  may,  nevertheless,  be  questioned  in
Congress itself.
Case: Pobre vs. Santiago, Aug. 25, 2009

## 31
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

Facts: Santiago  was  quoted  as  stating that  she wanted  "to  spit  on the  face  of  Chief  Justice  Artemio
Panganiban and his cohorts in the Supreme Court," and calling the Court a "Supreme Court of idiots."
Pobre  filed  a  complaint  asking  that  disbarment  proceedings  or  other  disciplinary  actions  be  taken
against the lady senator.
Issue: Whether the statements were covered by the constitutional provision on parliamentary immunity?
Held: Conformably to Art. VI, Sec. 11 of the Constitution, the complaint is DISMISSED. This Court is
aware  of  the  need  and  has  in  fact  been  in  the  forefront  in  upholding  the  institution  of  parliamentary
immunity and promotion of free speech.
Courts  do  not  interfere  with  the  legislature  or  its  members  in  the  manner  they  perform  their
functions  in  the  legislative  floor  or  in  committee  rooms.  Any  claim  of  an  unworthy  purpose  or  of  the
falsity and mala fides of the statement uttered by the member of the Congress does not destroy the
privilege.  The  disciplinary  authority  of  the  assembly  and  the voters,  not  the  courts,  can  properly
discourage or correct such abuses committed in the name of parliamentary immunity.
For  the  above  reasons,  the  plea  of  Senator  Santiago  for  the  dismissal  of  the  complaint  for
disbarment or disciplinary action is well taken. Indeed, her privilege speech is not actionable criminally
or in a disciplinary proceeding under the Rules of Court.
## Disqualifications:
Section 13. “No Senator or Member of the House of Representatives may hold any other office
or  employment  in  the  Government,  or  any  subdivision,  agency,  or  instrumentality  thereof,
including government-owned or controlled corporations or their subsidiaries, during his term
without  forfeiting  his  seat.  Neither  shall  he  be  appointed  to  any  office  which  may  have  been
created or the emoluments thereof increased during the term for which he was elected.”
The prohibited offices are:
- Incompatible office- (1
st
sentence of Se. 13).
Since  the  prohibition  is  only  during  his  tenure,  a  legislator  is  not  prevented  from  accepting  a
appointment.  However,  if  he  chooses  to  accept  another  office,  he  automatically  forfeits  his  seat  in
Congress. (Prof. Sandoval, UP BRI)
Forfeiture of the seat in Congress shall be automatic upon the member’s assumption of such
other office deemed incompatible with his seat in Congress.  However, no forfeiture shall take place if
the member of Congress holds the other government office in an ex officio capacity, e.g., membership
in the Board of Regents of UP, Chairman, Committee on education, in the Senate. (Nachura, Outline
Reviewer in Political Law, pg. 262)
The purpose is to prevent a member from owing loyalty to another branch of the government, to
the detriment of the independence of the legislature and the doctrine of separation of powers. (Justice
## Isagani Cruz)
- Forbidden office- (2
nd
sentence of Sec. 13).

The ban applies only for the duration of the term for which the member of Congress was elected
when such office was created or its emolument increased. The purpose is to prevent trafficking in public
office. (Cruz, Consti. Law1)
## Inhibitions:
Section 14. “No Senator or Member of the House of Representatives may personally appear as
counsel before any court of justice or before the Electoral Tribunals, or quasi-judicial and other
administrative  bodies.  Neither  shall  he,  directly  or  indirectly,  be  interested  financially  in  any
contract  with,  or  in  any  franchise  or  special  privilege  granted  by  the  Government,  or  any
subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including any government-owned or controlled
corporation,  or  its  subsidiary,  during  his  term  of  office.  He  shall  not  intervene  in  any  matter
before any office of the Government for his pecuniary benefit or where he may be called upon
to act on account of his office.”
The  prohibitions  are  intended  to  prevent  members  of  Congress  from  taking  advantage,
pecuniary or otherwise, of their position in their dealings with the courts, or in their business operations,
or in their dealings with any government agency or corporation.
In the 1
st
sentence of the provision, a lawyer legislature may not “personally appear as counsel
before any court of justice...” Appearance of legislator is barred before all courts of justice, regardless
of rank, composition  or  jurisdiction.  It  also  applies to the  Electoral  Tribunals  and  to  all  administrative
bodies like SEC and NLRC, also to court martial and military tribunals.
The  purpose  is  to  prevent  the  legislator  from  exercising  undue  influence,  deliberately  or  not,
upon the body where he is appearing.          (Cruz, Consti. Law1)
This prohibition cannot be circumvented under the guise of appearing “in intervention” in one’s
behalf.
Case: Puyat vs. de Guzman, 113 SCRA 31, 37
Facts: A  suit  for  certiorari  and  Prohibition  with  Preliminary  Injunction  is  poised  against  the  Order  of
respondent SEC granting Assemblyman Estanislao A. Fernandez leave to intervene in SEC Case No.
## 1747.
Issue: Whether or not Assemblyman Fernandez, as a then stockholder of IPI may intervene in the SEC
Case without violating Constitution?
Held: SC constrained  to  find  that  there  has  been  an  indirect  "appearance  as  counsel  before  an
administrative body" and that is a circumvention of the Constitutional prohibition. The "intervention" was
an afterthought to enable him to appear actively in the proceedings in some other capacity. To believe
the avowed purpose, that is, to enable him eventually to vote and to be elected as Director in the event
of an unfavorable outcome of the SEC Case would be pure naivete. He would still appear as counsel
indirectly.
A ruling upholding the "intervention" would make the constitutional provision ineffective. All an
Assemblyman  need  do,  if  he  wants  to influence  an  administrative  body  is  to  acquire  a  minimal

The Electoral Tribunal is an independent, impartial and non-partisan tribunal.

In the case of Bondoc vs. Pineda, the SC said that HRET was created as non-partisan court. It

## March 21, 1997)
Since the Constitution has constituted the Tribunals a “sole judge” of the legislative  election
contests, their decisions on such controversies are not subject to appeal to the SC. However, the SC is
not totally excluded. Under Art. VIII, Sec. 1, judicial power includes the authority “to determine whether
or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part
of any branch or instrumentality of the government”
- Commission on Appointments
The Commission on Appointment is independent of the two Houses of Congress; its employees
are  not, technically,  employees  of  Congress.  It  has  the  power  to  promulgate  its  own  rules  of
proceedings. It  I  a  creature  of  the  Constitution,  its  powers  do  not come  from  Congress  but  emanate
directly from the Constitution.
b. Powers
## - Electoral Tribunal
The Electoral Tribunal shall be the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and
qualifications of their respective Members.
The Electoral Tribunal may assume jurisdiction only after the winning candidate (who is a party
to  the  election  controversy)  shall  have  been  duly  proclaimed,  has  taken  his  oath  of  office  and  has
assumed the functions of the office, because it is only then that he is said to be a member of the Senate
or HR as the case may be. And thus, Comelec’s jurisdiction over the election  contest relating  to his
election, returns and qualifications ends. (Nachura, Outline Reviewer in Political Law)
Q:  Since  the  Comelec administers all election laws, when does a controversy leave the Comelec’s
control?
A: When there has been a proclamation and a defeated candidate claims to be the winner, clearly the
Electoral Tribunal has jurisdiction to the exclusion of the Comelec.
Q: Up to what point may the Comelec entertain protests before proclamation?
A: The scope of pre-proclamation controversy was limited to incomplete returns, or returns with
material defects, or returns which appeared to be tampered with, falsified or prepared under duress, or
containing discrepancies in the votes credited to any candidate the difference of which would affect the

## Law1)
-Commission on Appointments
The  Commission shall  have the  power  to  consent to  or  confirm  nominations  or  appointments
submitted to  it  by  the  President  pursuant  to  Article  VII,  Sec.  16  which  enumerates the  appointments
which needs action by the Commission. It serves as an administrative check on the appointing authority
of the president.
The Commission shall act on all appointments submitted to it within 30 session days of Congress
from their submission. The Commission shall rule by a majority vote of its members. The Commission
shall  meet  only  while  the  Congress  is  in  session,  at  the  call  of  its  Chairman  or  a  majority  of  all  its
members.
An ad interim appointments not acted upon at the time of the adjournment of the Congress, even
if the 30-day period has not yet expired, are deemed by-passed.
Powers of Congress
The Powers of Congress are classified into:
- Legislative  Power in General – refers  to  power  to  enact  laws  which  includes the  power  to alter  or
repeal them.
- Specific Legislative Powers- refers to powers expressly conferred by the Constitution.
Example: Power of Appropriation, Power of Taxation and Power of Expropriation.
- Non-legislative Powers- refers to powers which are not basically legislative in nature but which are
performed by Congress.
- Implied Powers- refers to powers which are not expressly conferred by the Constitution but which are
implied from those expressly granted.
- Inherent Powers- refers to powers which are inherent to the exercise of its legislative powers.
## Oversight Functions
Section 22. “The heads of departments may, upon their own initiative, with the consent of the
President, or upon the request of either House, as the rules of each House shall provide, appear
before  and  be  heard  by  such  House  on  any  matter  pertaining  to  their  departments.  Written
questions  shall  be  submitted  to  the  President  of  the  Senate  or  the  Speaker  of  the  House  of
Representatives at least three days before their scheduled appearance. Interpellations shall not
be limited to written questions, but may cover matters related thereto. When the security of the
State or the public interest so requires and the President so states in writing, the appearance
shall be conducted in executive session.”
Sec.  22  refers  to  the  power  to  conduct Question  Hour. The  objective  of  which is  to  obtain
information in pursuit of Congress’ oversight function. And in keeping with the doctrine of separation

of powers, the Congress may only request the appearance of department heads, who may appear with
the consent of the President.
The power  of  oversight  embraces  all  activities  undertaken  by  Congress  to  enhance  its
understanding of and influence over the implementation of legislation it has enacted.  Clearly, oversight
concerns post enactment measures undertaken by Congress:
a. to monitor bureaucratic compliance with program objectives,
b. to determine whether agencies are properly administered,
c. to eliminate executive waste and dishonesty,
d. to prevent executive usurpation of legislative authority, and
e. to assess executive conformity with the  congressional perception of public interest.
Congress uses its oversight power to make sure that the administrative agencies perform their
functions within the authority delegated to them.
Categories of Congressional Oversight functions:
## 1. Congressional Scrutiny
It implies a lesser intensity and continuity of attention to administrative operations. Its primary
purpose  is  to  determine  economy  and  efficiency  of  the  operation  of  government  activities.  In  the
exercise of legislative scrutiny, Congress may request information and report from the other branches
of government. It can give recommendations or pass resolution of the agency involved.
Legislative scrutiny is based primarily on the power of appropriation of Congress.
The power of appropriation carries with it the power to specify the project or activity to be funded.
Hence, the holding of budget hearing has been the usual means of reviewing the policy and auditing
the  use  of  previous  appropriation  to  ascertain  whether  they  have  been  disbursed  for  purposes
authorized in an appropriation act.
But  legislative  scrutiny  does  not  end  in  budget  hearings.  Congress  can  ask  the  heads  of
department to appear before and be heard by either House of Congress on any matter pertaining to
their departments.
Likewise,  Congress  exercises  legislative  scrutiny  thru  its  power  of  confirmation.  Through  the
power  of  confirmation,  Congress  shares  in  the  appointing  power  of  the  executive.  Theoretically,  it  is
intended  to  lessen  political  consideration  in  the  appointment  of  officials  in  sensitive  positions  in  the
government. It also provides Congress an opportunity to find out whether the nominee possesses the
necessary qualifications, integrity and probity required of all public servants.
## 2. Congressional Investigation
It involves more intense digging of facts. (See: Legislative Inquiries)
## 3. Legislative Supervision

It allows the Congress to scrutinize the exercise of delegated law-making authority, and permits
Congress to retain part of that delegated authority.
Congress exercises supervision over the executive agencies through its veto power. It typically
utilizes veto provisions when granting the President or an executive agency the power to promulgate
regulations with the force of law. These provisions require the President or an agency to present the
proposed regulations to Congress, which retains a right to approve or disapprove any regulation before
it takes effect. Such legislative veto provision usually provides that a proposed regulation will become
a law after the expiration of a certain period of time, only if Congress does not affirmatively disapprove
of the regulation in the meantime. Less frequently, the statute provides that a proposed regulation will
become law if Congress affirmatively approves it.                                (2010 Bar Review Vitamins by

Limitations on Legislative Power
The Revenue Power or the power to tax has the following limitations:
- It shall be uniform and equitable
Uniformity in taxation means that persons or things belonging to the same class shall be taxed
at the same rate.
Equality in taxation requires the tax imposed to be determined on the basis of the value of the
property.
Equitable  taxation means  that  the  tax  burden must  be  imposed according to the taxpayer’s
capacity to pay.
- Congress shall evolve a progressive system of taxation
A tax is progressive when the rate increases as the tax base increases.
- Charitable institutions, churches and personages or convents appurtenant thereto, mosques, non-
profit cemeteries, and all lands, buildings, and improvements, actually, directly, and exclusively used
for religious, charitable, or educational purposes shall be exempt from taxation.
- Law granting any tax exemption shall be passed only with the concurrence of a majority of all the
Members of the Congress.
-  Art.  XIV,  Sec  4(3)  All revenues  and  assets  of  non-stock,  non-profit  educational  institutions  used
actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes shall be exempt from taxes and duties.
Limitations on Appropriation (Fiscal Power)
Implied or Extra-constitutional Limitations on appropriation measures:
- It is essential that it be devoted to a public purpose.
- The sum authorized to be released must be determinate, or at least determinable.

a. General Appropriation law.
## Constitutional Limitations:
- All appropriation bills should originate in the House of Representative.
- Sec. 25(6) Discretionary funds appropriated for particular officials shall be disbursed only for
public  purposes  to  be  supported  by  appropriate  vouchers  and  subject  to  such  guidelines  as  may  be
prescribed by law.
-  Congress  may  not  increase  the  appropriations  recommended  by  the  President  for  the
operation of the Government as specified in the budget.
- The form, content, and manner of preparation of the budget shall be prescribed by law.
- No provision or enactment shall be embraced unless it relates specifically to some particular
appropriation  therein.  Any  such  provision  or  enactment  shall  be  limited  in  its  operation  to  the
appropriation to which it relates. This is intended to prevent riders, or irrelevant provisions included in
the bill to ensure its approval.
b. Special appropriation law.
## Constitutional Limitations:
- Must specify the public purpose for which the sum is intended.
- Must be supported by funds actually available as certified to by the National Treasurer, or to
be raised by a corresponding revenue proposal included therein.
Impoundement- The  refusal  of  the  President  for  whatever  reason  to  spend  funds  made  available  by
Congress. It is failure to spend or obligate budget authority of any type. This power of the President is
derived from Sec. 38 of the Administrative Code of 1987. (Nachura, Outline Reviewer in Political Law)

Presidential Veto and Congressional Override
The veto power of the President is an instrument of control over legislation completed by the
Congress. But Congress may override a presidential veto by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all its members.
As a general rule, if the President disapproves of a provision in a bill approve by Congress, he
should veto the entire bill. He is not allowed to veto separate parts of a bill while retaining others. It is
only in the case of appropriation, revenue, and tariff bills that he is authorized to exercise item-veto.
b. Non-Legislative
These are the powers which are not basically legislative in nature but which are performed by
## Congress.
## Example:
- power to propose amendments to the Constitution.

## (1) Informing Function
“ARTICLE VII, Section 23. The President shall address the Congress at the opening of its
regular session. He may also appear before it at any other time.”
## EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT
- Privileges, Inhibitions and Disqualifications
Section 13. “The President, Vice-President, the Members of the Cabinet, and their deputies or
assistants  shall  not,  unless  otherwise  provided  in  this  Constitution,  hold  any  other  office  or
employment  during  their  tenure.  They  shall  not,  during  said  tenure,  directly  or  indirectly,
practice  any  other  profession,  participate  in  any  business,  or  be  financially  interested  in  any
contract  with,  or  in  any  franchise,  or  special  privilege  granted  by  the  Government  or  any
subdivision,  agency,  or  instrumentality  thereof,  including  government-owned  or  controlled
corporations or their subsidiaries. They shall strictly avoid conflict of interest in the conduct of
their office.
The  spouse  and  relatives  by  consanguinity  or  affinity  within  the  fourth  civil degree  of  the
President  shall  not,  during  his  tenure,  be  appointed  as  Members  of  the  Constitutional
Commissions, or the Office of the Ombudsman, or as Secretaries, Undersecretaries, chairmen
or  heads  of  bureaus  or  offices,  including  government-owned  or  controlled  corporations  and
their subsidiaries.”
The intent of the framers was to impose stricter prohibition of the President and the official family
in so far as holding other offices or employment in the government or elsewhere is concerned.
The prohibition pertains to an office or employment in the government and government-owned
or controlled corporations or their subsidiaries.
In the latter provision, the disqualification is absolute, not being qualified by the phrase “in the
Government.” The prohibition imposed on the President and his official family is therefore all-embracing
and covers both public and private office or employment.
Except for the Vice-President who may be appointed to the Cabinet, the secretary of justice who
is made ex-officio member of the Judicial and Bar Council, the officials enumerated in section 13 may
not hold another office. But they may be given additional functions which are intimately related to their
primary office. Such conferment of additional functions does not constitute a new appointment.
It should also be noted that the stricter prohibition is imposed on “members of the Cabinet”. It
therefore applies not just to department secretaries, but to any one who is a member of the Cabinet
even if he or she is not a head of a department.
## The 2

par of Sec. 13 is essentially an anti-nepotism provision which even in statutes normally
goes up to the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity. If the 4

in  office  when  a  President  assumes  office,  the  relatives  are  not  thereby  ousted  from  their  positions.
What is prohibited is appointment or reappointment and not uninterrupted continuance in office.
a. Presidential Immunity
There is no provision in the Constitution clothing the President with immunity from suit during
his tenure.
In the case of  Soliven vs. Judge Makasiar, 167 SCRA 393, the SC confirmed the doctrime of
presidential Immunity, to wit:
The rationale for the grant to the President of the privilege of immunity from suit is to assure the
exercise  of  Presidential  duties  and  functions  free  from  any  hindrance  or  distraction,  considering that
being the Chief Executive of the Government is a job that, aside from requiring all of the office holder's
time, also demands undivided attention.
But this privilege of immunity from suit, pertains to the President by virtue of the office and may
be invoked only by the holder of the office; not by any other person in the President's behalf. Thus, an
accused in a criminal case in which the President is complainant cannot raise the presidential privilege
as a defense to prevent the case from proceeding against such accused.
Moreover,  there  is  nothing  in  our  laws  that  would  prevent  the  President  from  waiving  the
privilege. Thus, if so minded the President may shed the protection afforded by the privilege and submit
to  the  court's  jurisdiction.  The  choice  of  whether  to  exercise  the  privilege  or  to  waive  it  is  solely  the
President's prerogative. It is a decision that cannot be assumed and imposed by any other person.
After the tenure of office of the President, he cannot invoke immunity from suit for civil damages
arising out of acts done by him while he was a President which were not performed in the exercise of
official duties. (Estrada vs. Desierto, March 2, 2001)
b. Presidential Privilege
Executive  Privilege is  the  right  of  the  President  and  high-level  executive  branch  officers  to
withhold information from Congress, the courts, and ultimately the public. (Rozell)
Varieties of Executive Privileges:
- State Secrets Privilege- the information being withheld is of such a nature that its disclosure would
subvert crucial military or diplomatic objective.
- Informer’s Privilege- the  privilege  of  the  Government  not  to  disclose  the  identity  of  persons  who
furnish information of violations of law to officers charged with the enforcement of that law.
- Generic Privilege- for internal deliberations has been said to attach to intragovernmental documents
reflecting advisory opinions, deliberations and recommendations comprising part of a process by which
governmental decisions and policies are formulated. (Senate vs. Ermita, April 20, 2006)
In this jurisdiction, the doctrine of executive privilege was recognized by this Court in Almonte v.
Vasquez.  Almonte  used  the  term  in  reference  to  the  same  privilege  subject  of  Nixon.  It  quoted  the
following portion of the Nixon decision which explains the basis for the privilege:

## 41
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

"The expectation of a President to the confidentiality of his conversations and correspondences,
like  the  claim  of confidentiality  of  judicial  deliberations,  for  example,  has  all  the  values  to  which  we
accord deference for the privacy of all citizens and, added to those values, is the necessity for protection
of  the  public  interest  in  candid,  objective,  and  even  blunt or  harsh  opinions  in  Presidential  decision-
making. A President and those who assist him must be free to explore alternatives in the process of
shaping policies and making decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except
privately. These   are   the   considerations   justifying   a   presumptive   privilege   for   Presidential
communications. The privilege is fundamental to the operation of government and inextricably rooted
in the separation of powers under the Constitution x x x "
Similarly, in Chavez v. Public Estates Authority, the Court ruled that the right to information does
not extend to matters recognized as "privileged information under the separation of powers,"82 by which
the Court meant Presidential conversations, correspondences, and discussions in closed-door Cabinet
meetings. It also held that information on military and diplomatic secrets and those affecting national
security,  and  information  on  investigations  of  crimes  by  law  enforcement  agencies  before  the
prosecution of the accused were exempted from the right to information.
## 2. Power
Executive Power is the power to enforce and administer the laws. As the administrative head of
the government, the President is vested with the power to execute, administer and carry out laws into
practical operation. (National Electrification Administration vs. CA, Feb. 15, 2002)
Although the Constitution imposes limitations on the exercise of specific powers of the President,
it maintains intact what is traditionally considered as within the scope of “executive power”. The powers
of  the  president  are  not  limited  to  what  are  expressly  enumerated  in  the  article  on  the  Executive
Department  and  in  scattered  provisions  of the  Constitution. In  other  words,  executive  power  is more
than the um of specific powers so enumerated. It has been advanced that whatever power inherent in
the government that is neither legislative nor judicial has to be executive.
The Administrative Code of 1987 (E.O. 292) expressly grants the President continuing authority
to organize the Office of the President. The law grants the President this power in recognition of the
recurring  need  of  every  President  to  reorganize  his  office  “to  achieve  simplicity,  economy  and
efficiency”.  After  all,  the  Office  of  the  President  is  the  command  post  of  the  President.  This  is  the
rationale behind the President’s continuing authority to reorganize the administrative structure of the
Office of the President.
However, the President’s power to reorganize the Office of the President under Section 31 (2)
and  (3)  of  EO  292  should  be  distinguished  from  his  power  to  reorganize  the  Office  of  the  President
Proper. Under Section 31 (1) of EO 292, the President can reorganize the Office of the President Proper
by abolishing, consolidating or merging units, or by transferring functions from one unit to another. In
contrast, under Section 31 (2) and (3) of EO 292, the President’s power to reorganize offices outside
the  Office  of  the  President  Proper  but  still  within  the  Office  of  the  President  is  limited  to  merely
transferring functions or agencies from the Office of the President to Departments or Agencies, and vice
versa.
This distinction is crucial as it affects the security of tenure of employees. The abolition of an
office in good faith necessarily results in the employee’s cessation in office, but in such event there is

## 42

no  dismissal  or  separation  because  the  office  itself  ceases  to  exist. (Domingo  vs.  Zamora,  Feb.  06,
## 2003)
b. Power of Appointment
## (1) In General
Section  14. “Appointments  extended  by  an  Acting  President  shall  remain  effective,  unless
revoked by the elected President, within ninety days from his assumption or reassumption of
office.”
Appointment is  the  selection,  by  authority  vested  with  the  power,  of  an  individual  who  is  to
exercise  the  functions  of  a  given  office.  It  is  distinguished  from designation in  that  the  latter  simply
means the imposition of additional duties, usually by law, on a person already in the public service. It is
also different from the commission in that the latter is the written evidence of the appointment. (Nachura,
Outline Reviewer in Political Law)
Appointing power is the exclusive prerogative of the President, upon which no limitations may
be  imposed  by  Congress  except  those  resulting from  the  need  of  securing  the  concurrence  of  the
Commission  on  Appointments  and  from the  exercise  of the  limited  legislative  power to  prescribe  the
qualifications to a given appointive office. (Manalang vs. Quitoriano, 94 Phil. 903)
Kinds of Appointments:
- Permanent  appointments- are  those  extended  to  persons  possessing  the  qualifications  and  the
requisite eligibility and are thus protected by the constitutional guarantee of security of tenure.
- Temporary appointments- are given to persons without such eligibility, revocable at will and without
the necessity of just cause or a valid investigation; made on the understanding that the appointing power
has not yet decided on a permanent appointee and that the temporary appointee may be replaced at
any time a permanent choice is made.
Where a person is merely designated and not appointed, the implication is that he shall hold the
office only in a temporary capacity and may be replaces at will by the appointing authority. In this sense,
a designation is considered only an acting or temporary appointment which does not confer security of
tenure on the person named. (Binamira vs. Garrucho, 188 SCRA 154)
- Regular appointment- is one made by the President while Congress is in session, takes effect only
after confirmation by the Commission on Appointments, and once approved, continues until the end of
the term of the appointee.
In  regular  appointment,  the  President  does  not  really  appoint,  he  merely  nominates,  it  is  the
Commission  on  Appointments  who  has  the  power  to  approve  or  confirm  the  appointment. (Prof.
Sandoval, UP BRI)
- Ad interim appointment- is one made by the President while Congress is not in session, takes effect
immediately, but ceases to be valid if disapproved by the Commission on Appointments or upon the
next adjournment of Congress.  It is deemed “by-passed” through inaction.
Section 14 speaks of the power of the succeeding President to revoke appointments made by
an Acting President, and evidently refers only to appointments in the Executive Department. It has no

## 43
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

application  to  appointments  in  the  Judiciary,  because  temporary  or  acting  appointments  can  only
undermine the independence of the Judiciary due to their being revocable at will. The letter and spirit
of the Constitution safeguard that independence. Also, there is no law in the books that authorizes the
revocation of appointments in the Judiciary. Prior to their mandatory retirement or resignation, judges
of the first and second level courts and the Justices of the third level courts may only be removed for
cause, but the Members of the Supreme Court may be removed only by impeachment.
(2) Commission on Appointments Confirmation
Section  16. “The  President  shall  nominate  and,  with  the  consent  of  the  Commission  on
Appointments,  appoint  the  heads  of  the  executive  departments,  ambassadors,  other  public
ministers and consuls, or officers of the armed forces from the rank of colonel or naval captain,
and  other  officers  whose  appointments  are  vested  in  him  in  this  Constitution.  He  shall  also
appoint all other officers of the Government whose appointments are not otherwise provided for
by law, and those whom he may be authorized by law to appoint. The Congress may, by law,
vest the appointment of other officers lower in rank in the President alone, in the courts, or in
the heads of departments, agencies, commissions, or boards.
The President shall have the power to make appointments during the recess of the Congress,
whether   voluntary   or   compulsory,   but   such   appointments   shall   be   effective   only   until
disapproved  by  the  Commission  on  Appointments  or  until  the  next  adjournment  of  the
## Congress.”
There  is  limited  number  of  officials  whose  appointments  under  the  Constitution  require  the
consent of the Commission on Appointments:
-  heads of the executive departments,
Not every officers of Cabinet rank needs confirmation. It the vice-president is appointed head of
an executive department, it does not need confirmation.
- ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls,
-  officers of the armed forces from the rank of colonel or naval captain,
Appointment  of  police  generals  does  not  need  confirmation  because  they  are  not  military
officers, the Constitution characterized police force as civilian.
- other officers whose appointments are vested in him in this Constitution.
Appointment  of  sectoral  representatives  needs  confirmation  because  they  come  under  the
clause “other officers whose appointments are vested in him in this Constitution.”
The  phrase  “all  other  officers  of  the  Government  whose  appointments  are  not  otherwise
provided for by law” means that when a law creating an office does not specify who shall appoint the
officer, the appointment must be made by the President.
Its actuation in the exercise of its power to approve appointments submitted to it by the President
of the  Philippines  is  exempt  from judicial  supervision  and  interference,  except  on  a  clear showing  of
such arbitrary and improvident use of the powers as will constitute a denial of due process.

REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

Section  16  covers  only  the  presidential  appointments  that  require  confirmation  by  the
Commission  on  Appointments.  Thereby,  the  Constitutional  Commission  restored  the  requirement  of
confirmation by the Commission on Appointments after the requirement was removed from the 1973
Constitution.  Yet,  because  of  Section  9  of  Article  VIII,  the  restored  requirement  did  not  include
appointments to the Judiciary.
Par. 2 of Sec. 16 refers to “ad-interim” appointments.
It is intended to prevent interruptions in vital government services that would otherwise result
from prolonged vacancies in government offices.
It  is  a  permanent  appointment  because  it  takes  effect  immediately  and  can  no  longer  be
withdrawn  by  the  President  once  the  appointee has  qualified  into  office. The  fact that  it  is  subject to
confirmation  by  the  Commission  on  Appointments  does  not  alter  its  permanent  character. The
Constitution itself makes an ad interim appointment permanent in character by making it effective until
disapproved by the Commission on Appointments or until the next adjournment of Congress.
An ad interim appointment can be terminated for two causes specified in the Constitution. The
first cause is the disapproval of his ad interim appointment by the Commission on Appointments. The
second cause is the adjournment of Congress without the Commission on Appointments acting on his
appointment.
There  is  no  dispute  that  an ad  interim appointee  disapproved  by  the  Commission  on
Appointments can no longer be extended a new appointment. The disapproval is a final decision of the
Commission on Appointments in the exercise of its checking power on the appointing authority of the
President.  The  disapproval  is  a  decision  on  the  merits,  being  a  refusal  by  the  Commission  on
Appointments  to  give  its consent  after  deliberating  on  the  qualifications  of  the  appointee.  Since  the
Constitution does not provide for any appeal from such decision, the disapproval is final and binding on
the appointee as well as on the appointing power. In this instance, the President can no longer renew
the appointment not because of the constitutional prohibition on reappointment, but because of a final
decision by the Commission on Appointments to withhold its consent to the appointment. (Matibag vs.
## Benipayo, April 2, 2002)
## (3) Midnight Appointments
Section 15. “Two months immediately before the next presidential elections and up to the
end of his term, a President or Acting President shall not make appointments, except temporary
appointments  to  executive  positions  when continued  vacancies  therein  will  prejudice  public
service or endanger public safety.”
The provision is a limitation on the President’s power of appointment. The principal purpose for
the ban on midnight appointments is to arrest any attempt to prolong the outgoing President’s powers
by means of proxies.
Exceptions form the Prohibition:
-  Temporary  appointments  to  executive  positions  when  continued  vacancies  will  prejudice  public
service or endanger public safety;

## 45
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

-  Members of the Supreme Court.                                  (DE CASTRO vs. JBC and ARROYO, April
## 20, 2010)
In In  re  Appoinment  of  Valenzuela,  1998,  the  SC  said  that  the  prohibition  under  section  15
applies even to appointments to the judiciary. The only exception is temporary appointments which can
only be extended to executive positions when continued vacancies therein will prejudice public service
or endanger public safety.
However, in a recent case decided by SC, (DE CASTRO vs. JBC and ARROYO, April 20, 2010)
it held that the ban on midnight appointments is placed in Article VII, not in Article VIII, because it limits
an  executive,  not  a  judicial power. Had  the  framers  intended  to  extend  the  prohibition  contained  in
Section 15, Article VII to the appointment of Members of the Supreme Court, they could have explicitly
done so. They could not have ignored the meticulous ordering of the provisions. They would have easily
and surely written the prohibition made explicit in Section 15, Article VII as being equally applicable to
the  appointment  of  Members  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  Article  VIII  itself,  most  likely  in  Section  4  (1),
Article  VIII.  That  such  specification  was  not  done  only  reveals  that the  prohibition  against  the
President  or  Acting  President  making  appointments  within  two  months  before the  next
presidential elections and up to the end of the President’s or Acting President’s term does not
refer to the Members of the Supreme Court.
Furthermore, SC said as the highest court of the land, may be guided but is not controlled by
precedent (Valenzuela  case).  Thus,  the  Court,  especially  with  a  new  membership,  is  not  obliged  to
follow blindly a particular decision that it determines, after re-examination, to call for a rectification.
(4) Power of Removal
The power of removal may be implied from the power of appointment. However, the President
cannot  remove  officials  appointed  by  him  where  the  Constitution  prescribes  certain  methods  for
separation  of  such  officers  from  public  service,  e.g.,  Chairmen  and  Commissioners  of  Constitutional
Commissions who can be removed only by impeachment, or judges who are subject to the disciplinary
authority of the Supreme Court. In the cases where the power of removal is lodged in the President, the
same  may  be  exercised  only  for  cause  as  may  be  provided  by  law, and  in  accordance  with  the
prescribed administrative procedure.
c. Power of Control and Supervision
Section  17. “The  President  shall  have  control  of  all  the  executive  departments,  bureaus,  and
offices. He shall ensure that the laws be faithfully executed.”
The power of control- is "the power of the President to alter or modify or nullify or set aside what
a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the
former with that of the latter."
The power of supervision- is “the power of superior officer to ensure that the laws are faithfully
executed” by inferiors.
The power of control necessarily includes the power of supervision but the power of supervision
does not include the power of control.
(1) Doctrine of Qualified Political Agency

## 46
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

This  presidential  power  of  control  over  the  executive  branch  of  government  extends  over  all
executive officers from Cabinet Secretary to the lowliest clerk and has been held by us, in the landmark
case of Mondano vs. Silvosa, to mean "the power of the President to alter or modify or nullify or set
aside  what  a  subordinate  officer  had  done  in  the  performance  of  his  duties  and  to  substitute  the
judgment of the former with that of the latter." It is said to be at the very "heart of the meaning of Chief
## Executive."
As a corollary rule to the control powers of the President, is the "Doctrine of Qualified Political
Agency". As the President cannot be expected to exercise his control powers all at the same time and
in person, 20 he will have to delegate some of them to his Cabinet members.
The Supreme Court recently upheld Memorandum Circular No. 58, promulgated by the Office
of the President on June 30, 1993, which bars an appeal or a petition for review to the Office of the
President  of  decisions/orders/resolutions  of  the  Secretary  of  Justice  except  those  involving  offenses
punishable by reclusion perpetua or death. (Angeles v. Gaite, November, GR No. 165276, 25, 2009)
d. Military Powers
The Military Power provision speaks of the three powers:
- Calling Out power as a commander-in-chief of the AFP;
## 2. Martial Law Power;
- Power to Suspend the Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus
Differences of Treatment of the three powers:
The Martial Law Power and the Power to Suspend the Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus
are  greater  power  as  it  involves  the  curtailment  of  fundamental  and  civil  rights/liberties  of  people,
therefore subject to judicial review.
While the Calling Out Power is the lesser and denied power as it does not involve curtailment of
fundamental and civil liberties of the people, hence not subject to judicial review, unless, there has been
a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the President. And
the  fact  can  be  clearly  shown  by  the  petitioner  applying  the  doctrine  of  expanded  power  of  judicial
review. (Prof. Sandoval, UP BRI)
Limitations to the Military Power:
-  He  may call  out  such  armed forces  to  prevent  or  suppress  lawless violence,  invasion  or  rebellion
only.
- The  grounds  for  suspension  of the  privilege  of  the  writ  of  habeas  corpus and  the  proclamation  of
martial law are now limited only to invasion or rebellion.
- The duration of suspension and proclamation should not exceed 60 days following which it shall be
lifted, unless extended by Congress.
- The President shall submit a report in person or in writing to the Congress within forty-eight hours
from the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.

## 47
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

- The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a majority of all its Members in regular or special
session, may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the
## President.
- The Congress may extend such proclamation or suspension for a period to be determined by the
Congress,  if  the  invasion  or  rebellion  shall  persist  and  public  safety  requires  it. The  initiative  for
extension, however, can only come from the President.
- The Supreme Court may review, in an appropriate proceeding filed by any citizen, the sufficiency of
the  factual  basis  of  the  proclamation  of  martial  law  or  the  suspension  of  the  privilege  of  the  writ  of
habeas corpus or the extension thereof, and must promulgate its decision thereon within 30 days from
its filing.
- The  suspension  of  the  privilege  of the  writ  of habeas  corpus  shall  apply  only  to  persons judicially
charged for rebellion or offenses inherent in, or directly connected with, invasion.
- A state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution, nor supplant the functioning
of the civil courts or legislative assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military courts
and  agencies  over  civilians  where  civil  courts  are  able  to  function,  nor  automatically  suspend  the
privilege of the writ.
It means that ordinary legislation continues to belong to the legislative bodies even during martial
law.
- During the  suspension  of the  privilege  of  the  writ  of  habeas  corpus, any  person  thus  arrested  or
detained  shall  be  judicially  charged  within  three  days,  otherwise  he  shall  be  released. (Suarez,  6
th

Months Before the Bar)
In  the  case David  vs.  Arroyo, when  President  Arroyo  issued  PP  1017,  what  power did  she
actually exercised?
Q. Was it Emergency Power?
A. No. Par. 2, Sec. 23, Art. VI laid down the conditions in the exercise of Emergency power, to wit:
(2)  In  times  of  war  or  other  national  emergency,  the  Congress  may,  by  law,
authorize  the  President,  for  a  limited  period  and  subject  to  such  restrictions  as  it  may
prescribe,  to  exercise  powers  necessary  and  proper  to  carry  out  a  declared  national
policy. Unless sooner withdrawn by resolution of the Congress, such powers shall cease
upon the next adjournment thereof.
Clearly therefore, emergency power is merely a delegated power to the President. The President
may not validly exercise it mutu propio. At the time of the issuance of PP 1017, no law was enacted by
Congress authorizing the President to exercise emergency power.
Q. Was it Martial Law power?
A. No. two conditions in the exercise of this power are found in Sec. 8, Art. VII:
- In case of invasion or rebellion;

REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

- when the public safety requires it.
In that case, the SC held that Pres. Arroyo exercised her Calling Out Power as the commander-
in-chief  of  the  AFP.  This  power  as  a  general  rule  is  not  subject  to  judicial  review  as  it  is  a  political
question. The only exception is when the president exercises said power with grave abuse of discretion
amounting to  lack  or  excess  of jurisdiction.  And the  burden  of  proof  lies  on  the  part  of the  petitioner
assailing the act. In the case at bar, the petitioner fails to meet the burden of proof.
What was declared ultra vires in this case is the act of the police officers of affecting warrantless
arrest and the taking over of the Tribune Publishing House. (Prof. Salvador, UP BRI)
e. Pardoning Power
Section 19. “Except in cases of impeachment, or as otherwise provided in this Constitution, the
President may grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after
conviction by final judgment.
He  shall  also  have  the  power  to  grant  amnesty  with  the  concurrence  of  a  majority  of  all  the
Members of the Congress.”
(1) Nature and Limitations
The  power  of  executive  clemency  is  a  non-delegable  power  and  must  be  exercised  by  the
President  personally.  This  power  is  granted  for  the  purpose  of  relieving  the  harshness  of  the  law  or
correcting mistakes in the administration of justice.
The exercise of Pardoning Power is discretionary in the President and may not be controlled by
the legislature or reversed by the Courts, save only when it contravenes the limitations discussed below:
Sec. 19 sets down the 1
st
three limitations on the power of executive clemency:
- It cannot be exercised over cases of impeachment;
- Reprieves, commutations, and pardons, and remission of fines and forfeitures can only be given after
conviction by final judgment.
- A grant of amnesty must be with the concurrence of a majority of all the Members of the Congress.
- No  pardon,  amnesty,  parole,  or  suspension  of  sentence  for  violation  of  election  laws,  rules,  and
regulations shall be granted by the President without the favorable recommendation of the Commission.
(Art. IX, C, Sec.5)
-  Pardon  cannot  be  extended  to  a  person  convicted  of  legislative  contempt  (this  would  violate  the
doctrine of separation of powers) or of civil contempt (this would violate the benefit not of State itself
but of private litigant whose rights have been violated by contemnor. (Justice Isagani Cruz)
- Pardon cannot be extended for the purpose of absolving the pardoned of civil liability.
- Pardon also will not restore offices that ha been forfeited.
(2) Forms of Executive Clemency

## 49
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

- Pardon- is an act of grace which exempts the individual on whom it I bestowed from the punishment
which the law inflicts for the crime he has committed.
- Reprieves- is merely a postponement of a sentence to a date certain, or a stay of execution. The
purpose is to enable the government to secure additional evidence to ascertain the guilt of convict.
- Commutations- is a reduction or mitigation of the penalty, i.e. when death sentence is reduced to life
imprisonment.
- Amnesty- grant of general pardon to a class political offenders either after conviction or even before
the changes are filed.
- Remission  of  fines  and  forfeiture- it  is  a  self-explanatory  term.  However  it  should  be  noted  that
remission of fines and forfeiture merely prevents the collection of fines of the confiscation of forfeited
property; it cannot have the effect of returning the property which has been vested in third parties or
money already in the public treasury.
Kinds of Pardon
- Absolute or Conditional
Absolute pardon- extended without any string attached. The pardonee has no option at all and
must accept it whether he likes it or not.
Conditional  pardon- under  which  the  convict  is  required  to  comply  with  certain  requirements.
The offender has the right to reject it since he may feel that condition imposed is more onerous than
penalty sought to be remitted.
- Plenary or Partial
Plenary  pardon- extinguishes  all  the  penalties  imposed  upon  offender,  including  accessory
liabilities.
Partial pardon- does not extinguished accessory liabilities.
Mere commission, not necessarily conviction by the Court of any other crime, is enough in order
that   petitioner,   may   be   deemed   to   have   violated   the   condition   of   his   parole   or   pardon.
The  executive  can  only  allege  the  commission  of  an  offense;  it  is  for  the  judiciary  to  declare  such
commission in the form of conviction.
Amnesty can  be  granted  by  the  President  only  with  the  concurrence  of  Congress.  This
concurrence must be given by the majority of all members of Congress.
Rule on amnesty: it requires a previous admission of guilt since a person would not need the
benefit of amnesty unless he were, to begin with, guilty of the offense covered by the proclamation.
Distinctions between Amnesty and Pardon:
- Amnesty usually addressed to crimes against sovereignty of State; pardon condones infractions of
peace of State.

## 50
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

- Amnesty usually generally addressed to classes or even communities of persons; pardon is usually
addressed to individual.
- In amnesty, there may or may not be distinct acts of acceptance; in pardon, there must be distinct
acts od acceptance.
- Amnesty requires concurrence of Congress; pardon does not.
- Amnesty is a public act of which the courts take judicial notice; pardon is private act of the President.
-  Amnesty  looks  backward  and  abolishes  and  puts  into  oblivion  the  offenses  itself;  pardon  looks
forward and relieves the offender from consequences of offense of which he has been convicted.

f. Diplomatic Power
Section 21. “No treaty or international agreement shall be valid and effective unless concurred
in by at least two-thirds of all the Members of the Senate.”
The President is supposed to be the spokesman of the nation on external affairs.
- He may deal with foreign states and government.
- Extend or withhold recognition.
- Maintain diplomatic relations.
- Enter into treaties.
- Transact business of foreign relations.
International agreement was not intended to include the executive agreement which apparently
can still be concluded by the President alone without the necessity of Senate concurrence. Treatties
and international agreements concluded by the President are subject to check by the Supreme Court,
which has the power to declare them unconstitutional.
g. Residual Powers
In Marcos vs. Manglapus, 177 SCRA 668, SC concluded that the President had the authority to
prevent the return of Mr. Marcos even in the absence of a specific law granting her such authority, the
SC laid down the premise for its inclusion asserting the existence of “residual powers” not specifically
mentioned in the Constitution.”
In Malaria Employees and Workers Association of the Philippines vs. Romulo, July 31, 2007, it
was  held  that  the  President  has  the  authority  to  carry  out  a  reorganization  of  the  DOH  under  the
Constitution and statutes. This authority is an adjunct of the President’s power of control under Art. VII,
Sec. 1 and 17, and it is also an exercise of his “residual powers”. However, the President must exercise
good faith in carrying out the reorganization of any branch or agency of the executive department.
## JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT
Judicial power is vested in:

## 51
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

- Supreme Court – the only Constitutional Court;
- Such lower courts as may be established by law.
Lower Courts – are statutory creations referred to as other courts below the SC, they includes Court
of Appeals, RTC, MTC, MeTC and MCTC.
Judicial power is not simply the power but remains the duty of the court. (Prof. Sandoval, UP
## BRI).
The concept and definition of judicial power under has two parts: (par. 2, Sec. 1, Art. VIII)
-  Traditional  concept:  The  duty to  settle  actual  controversies  involving  rights  which  are  legally
demandable and enforceable before the courts of justice or the redress of wrongs for violation of such
rights;
- Expanded power of judicial review: To determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the
## Government.
It  also  include  the  power  to  review  even  the  political  decisions  of  the  executive  and    the
legislative and to declare their acts invalid for lack or excess of jurisdiction because tainted with grave
abuse of discretion.
Grave abuse of discretion- is meant such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is
equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of discretion must be patent and gross as to amount to an
evasion  of  positive  duty  or  a  virtual  refusal  to  perform  a  duty  enjoined  by  law,  or  not  to  act  at  all  in
contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason
of passion or hostility.(Bernas,Political Law1)
Grave abuse of discretion may arise when a lower court or tribunal violates or contravenes the
Constitution, the law or existing jurisprudence.
Limitations on Judicial Power:
- By the principle of separation of powers, Courts may neither attempt to assume nor be compelled to
perform non-judicial functions.
- General rule: Political questions are beyond the pale of judicial review.
Exception: It is well within the power and jurisdiction of the Court to inquire whether there is a violation
of the Constitution or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.

- It is not the function of the judiciary to give advisory opinion. The giving of such opinion is not the
exercise of judicial function.

- General rule: In moot and academic cases, the Court has nothing to do but to dismiss the case.
Exceptions:  a.  there  is  gross  violation  of  the  Constitution;  b.  in  exceptional  circumstances  and
paramount public interest is involve; c. when the issue raised requires formulation o principle to guide
the bench, bar and public.

b. Judicial Review
Judicial Review is the assertion of solemn and sacred obligation assigned to the judiciary by the
Constitution  to determine conflicting claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the

## 52

parties in an actual controversy the right which that instrument secures and guarantees to them. (Angara
s. Elec. Com. 63Phil. 139)
The Supreme Court, in the exercise of its power of judicial review, may review decisions of the
Office of the President on questions of law and jurisdiction, when properly raised. This does not mean
judicial  supremacy  over  the  Office  of  the  President  but the  performance  by  this  Court  of  a  duty
specifically enjoined upon it by the Constitution, as part of a system of checks and balances. (Roche
vs. Roche, April 30, 1987)
Political  Question- is  a  question  of  policy,  which  is  to  be  decided  by  the  people  in  their
sovereign  capacity  or  by  the  legislative  or  the  executive  branch  of  the  government  to  which  full
discretionary authority has been delegated. It is concerned with issues dependent upon the wisdom,
not legality of a particular measure. (Tanada vs. Cuenco)
Justiciable Question- Where the vortex of the controversy refers to the legality or validity of
the contested act, that matter is definitely justiciable ornon-political, i.e. the determination of whether or
nota constitutional provision has been followed or not. (Suarez, 6

1) representative of the Integrated Bar,
2) professor of law,
3) retired Member of the Supreme Court, and
4) representative of the private sector
In Sec. 9, for every vacancy the JBC submits to the President a list of at least three (3) names.
The President my not appoint anybody who is not in the list. If the President is not satisfied with the
names  in  the  list,  he may  ask  for  another  list. Once  the  appointment  is  issued  by  the  President and
accepted by the nominee, it needs no further confirmation. For the lower courts, the President is given
90 days from submission of the list within which to issue the appointment.
## 5. Supreme Court
Section 4. (1) “The Supreme Court shall be composed of a Chief Justice and fourteen Associate
Justices. It may sit en banc or in its discretion, in division of three, five, or seven Members. Any
vacancy shall be filled within ninety days from the occurrence thereof.
That the division can be of different sizes is supposed to reflect the relative importance of the
cases.    There can  thus  be  as  many  as  five  divisions  in  the  SC  thereby  allowing  for  a  more  speedy
disposition of cases before the SC. Except for those cases which by command of the Constitution must
be heard by SC en banc, cases may be heard either en banc or by a division as the Rules of Court may
provide. (Bernas, Political Law 1)
The following cases are to heard and decided en banc:
- All cases involving the constitutionality of a treaty, international or executive agreement, or law;
- Cases involving the constitutionality, application, or operation of presidential decrees, proclamations,
orders, instructions, ordinances, and other regulations;
- Cases heard by a division when the required majority in the division is not obtained;
- Cases where the Supreme Court modifies or reverses a doctrine or principle of law previously laid
down either en banc or in division;
- Administrative cases where the vote is for the dismissal of a judge of a lower court or otherwise to
discipline such a one;
- All cases which under the Rules of Court may be required to be heard en banc; and
-  Election contests for President or Vice-President.
When the SC sits en banc, cases are decided by the concurrence “of a majority of the Members
who actually took part in the deliberations on the issues in the case and voted thereon. This reflects a
two-fold desire of the Commission:
- not to allow the absence of some members of the SC or their non-participation in deliberations to
delay decisions, and

- to require that only those thoroughly familiar with the case participate in the decision.
## CONSTITUTIONAL COMMISSIONS
Civil Service Commission- is the personnel office of the government.
Commission on Audit- is the auditing office of the government.
COMELEC- is charged with the administration of the all important electoral process.
As  these  Commissions  perform  vital  governmental  functions,  they  have  to  be  protected  from
external influences and political pressures. Hence, they were made constitutional bodies, independent
of and not under any department of the government.  Certainly, they are not under the control of the
President. (Carpio vs. Executive Secretary, Feb 14, 1992)
## 1. Institutional Independence Safeguards
Reasons why they are called Independent Commissions:
- The said commissions are independent constitutional bodies.
(Sec. 1(a), Art. IX). The Constitutional Commissions, which shall be independent,
are the Civil Service Commission, the Commission on Elections, and the Commission on
## Audit.
- The Members of Constitutional Commissions cannot be removed from office except by impeachment

directly or indirectly, in any contract with, or in any franchise or privilege granted by the
Government,   any   of   its   subdivisions,   agencies,   or   instrumentalities,   including
government-owned or controlled corporations or their subsidiaries.
Notes: Practice of profession for the purpose of prohibition does not include teaching.
The  prohibition  of  active  management  of  a  business  does  not  prohibit  a  commissioner  from
owning  a  business  but  it  prohibits  him  from  being  a  managing  officer  or  a  member  of the  governing
board of a business  “which in any way may be affected by the functions of his office,” a qualifying
phrase which does not apply to the prohibition of practice of a profession. (Bernas, Political Law 1)

## THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
ARTICLE IX (C), Section 2-  implicitly grants the Comelec the power to promulgate rules and
regulations in the enforcement of laws relative to elections. It includes:
a. ascertainment of the identity of a political party and its leditimate officers.
b. decide all questions affecting elections.
c. register and regulate political parties.
d. ensure orderly elections.
e. authority to annul the results of a plebiscite.
f.  regulate  the  enjoyment  and  utilization  of  all  franchises  and  permits  for  the  operation  of
transportation and public utilities, media of communication or information.
g. power to declare failure of election.

But  it  does  not  authorize  the  Comelec, motu  propio,  without the  proper  proceedings, to  deny
due course to or cancel a certificate of candidacy filed in due form.
The power of direct control and supervision of the DILG over SK elections does not contravene
the  constitutional  grant of  power to  the  Comeles,  in  as  much  as the  election,  and  contests  involving
election of SK officials do not fall within the jurisdiction of the Comelec. (Nachura, Outline Reviewer in
## Political Law)

(2) Exercise exclusive original jurisdiction over all contests relating to the elections, returns,
and qualifications of all elective regional, provincial, and city officials, and appellate jurisdiction
over  all  contests  involving  elective  municipal  officials  decided  by  trial  courts  of  general
jurisdiction, or involving elective barangay officials decided by trial courts of limited jurisdiction.
Decisions, final orders, or rulings of the Commission on election contests involving elective
municipal and barangay offices shall be final, executory, and not appealable.
It may include:
a. Exclusive jurisdiction over pre-proclamation cases
b. Power to issue writs of certiorari, prohibition and mandamus.
c.  Exclusive  appellate  jurisdiction  over  decisions  of  MTC  in  electoral  cases  involving  elective
barangay officials.
d. Authority to suspend the reglementary periods provided by its rules, or requirement of non-
forum shopping, in the interest of justice and speedy resolution of cases.
e.  Power  to  cite  for  contempt,  but  this  power  may  be  exercised  only  while  the  Comelec  is
engaged in the performance of quasi-judicial functions.

The jurisdiction over elections for Sangguniang Kabataan is given to the department of Local
## Government.
Decisions, final orders, or rulings of the Comelec of all contest involving elective municipal and
barangay offices shall be final, executory, and not appealable. But the non-appealable character refers
only to questions of fact and not of law. Such decisions remain subject to the jurisdiction of SC through
the special civil action of certiorari under Rule 65 within thirty (30) days from receipt of a copy thereof
in accordance with Art. IX, A, Sec.7.
(3)  Decide,  except  those  involving  the  right  to  vote,  all  questions  affecting  elections,
including determination of the number and location of polling places, appointment of election
officials and inspectors, and registration of voters.

## 58
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

The  only  questions that may  not  be touched by the  Comelec  are “those involving the right to
vote”. The power to determine whether or not a person can exercise or is precluded from exercising the
right to vote is a judicial question.
When exercising its purely administrative powers under this paragraph, the Comelec may not
punish contempt.
Decisions/  determinations  made  by  Comelec  in  the  exercise  of  this  power,  being  merely
administrative in character, may be questioned in an ordinary civil action before trial courts.
(4)  Deputize,  with  the  concurrence  of  the  President,  law  enforcement  agencies  and
instrumentalities  of  the  Government,  including  the  Armed  Forces  of  the  Philippines,  for  the
exclusive purpose of ensuring free, orderly, honest, peaceful, and credible elections.
The Comelec may recommend to the President the removal of any officer it has deputized, or
the imposition of any sanction, for disobedience, violation, or disregard of its orders.
(5) Register, after sufficient publication, political parties, organizations, or coalitions which,
in addition to other requirements, must present their platform or program of government; and
accredit  citizens'  arms  of  the  Commission  on  Elections.  Religious  denominations  and  sects
shall not be registered. Those which seek to achieve their goals through violence or unlawful
means,  or  refuse  to  uphold  and  adhere  to  this  Constitution,  or  which  are  supported  by  any
foreign government shall likewise be refused registration.
Financial  contributions  from  foreign  governments  and  their  agencies  to  political  parties,
organizations, coalitions, or candidates related to elections, constitute interference in national
affairs,  and,  when  accepted,  shall  be  an  additional  ground  for  the  cancellation  of  their
registration with the Commission, in addition to other penalties that may be prescribed by law.
Instances when the Comelec can refuse registration:
- Religious denominations and sects shall not be registered;
-  Those  which  seek to achieve  their  goal  through  violence  and  unlawful  means  shall  not  be
registered;
- Those which refuse to uphold and adhere to the Constitution shall also be refused registration;
and
- Those which are supported by any foreign government.

The last paragraph of Sec. 2(5) refers to a situation where one political party is already registered
but it has accepted financial contributions from foreign governments. This is a ground for cancellation
of registration.
The  prohibition  does  not  refer  to  political  parties  which  draw  their  inspiration  from  religious
beliefs,  such  as  the  Christian  Democrats  or  the  Christian  Social  Movement.  These  are  not  religious
sects  or  denominations.  Nor  is  the  prohibition  intended  to  prevent  priests  or  religious  leaders  from
registering as candidates.
(6) File, upon a verified complaint, or on its own initiative, petitions in court for inclusion or
exclusion  of  voters;  investigate  and,  where  appropriate,  prosecute  cases  of  violations  of
election   laws,   including   acts   or   omissions constituting   election   frauds,   offenses,   and
malpractices.

## 59
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

The power to investigate and prosecute violations of election laws is an exclusive power of the
Comelec. Thus, Fiscals or Prosecutors can file information charging an election offense only when they
have been deputized  by  the  Commission.  However,  disciplinary  authority  over  such  Fiscals  and
Prosecutors remain  with  the  Secretary  of  Justice.  The  most that the Comelec  can  do  is  recommend
disciplinary action.
(7) Recommend to the Congress effective measures to minimize election spending, including
limitation of places where propaganda materials shall be posted, and to prevent and penalize all
forms of election frauds, offenses, malpractices, and nuisance candidacies.
(8) Recommend to the President the removal of any officer or employee it has deputized, or
the imposition of any other disciplinary action, for violation or disregard of, or disobedience to,
its directive, order, or decision.
(9)  Submit  to  the  President  and  the  Congress,  a  comprehensive  report  on  the  conduct  of
each election, plebiscite, initiative, referendum, or recall.
Sec. 2 (7), (8) and (9) enumerates some specific recommendatory powers.
Like  the  CSC,  Comelec  is  an  administrative  agency,  As  such,  the  powers  it  possesses  are
executive, quasi-judicial,  and  quasi-legislative.  By  exception,  however,  it has  given judicial  power as
“sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of all regional, provincial
and  city  officials.  However,  Comelec  cannot  claim  to  exercise  the  so-called  inherent  powers  of  the
regular courts. (Bernas, Political Law 1)
Executive  Power: It  shall  enforce  and  administer  all  laws relative  to  the  conduct  of  an  election,
plebiscite, initiative, referendum and crecall.
Legislative Power: It shall issue rules and regulations to implement the election laws. It has the power
to exercise such legislative functions as may be expressly delegated to it by Congress.
Judicial Power: It has the power to resolve all cases or controversies that may arise in the enforcement
of election laws. It is the sole judge of all pre-proclamation disputes and all contests relating to election,
returns and qualifications of all regional, provincial and city officials. (Suarez, 6th Months Before the Bar

## 60

elections includes:
- The power to determine the validity or nullity of the votes questioned by either of the contestants;
- The power to exclude election returns on the ground of statistical improbability;
- The power to exclude election returns which were the products of coercion;
- The power to obtain the testimony of handwriting experts to be able to determine if the election returns
are falsified or not.                                 (Suarez, 6th Months Before the Bar Outline)
## THE COMMISSION ON AUDIT
ARTICLE  IX  (D),  Section 2 gives a  broad  outline  of  the powers  and  functions of  the
Commission on Audit:
- To examine and audit all forms of government revenues;
- To examine and audit all forms of government expenditures;
- To settle government accounts;
It means the power to settle liquidated accounts, that is, those accounts which may be adjusted
simply  by  an  arithmetical  process.  It  does  not  include  the  power  to  fix  the  amount  of  an  unfixed  or
undetermined debt.
- To define the scope and techniques for its own auditing procedures;
-  To promulgate accounting and auditing rules “including those for the prevention and disallowance of
irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or unconscionable expenditures; and
- To decide administrative cases involving expenditure of public funds.
The  power  of  the  COA  to  define  the  scope  of  its  audit  and  examination  and  to  establish  the
techniques it will follow is exclusive. This is intended to prevent conflict. These matters, after all, require
special expertise. (Bernas, Political Law 1)

## 61
REVIEW NOTES ON PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTION                                            Atty. Joanna Marie A. Liao

The auditing authority of the COA over government-owned corporations extends only to those
“with original charter”. It has authority not just over accountable officers   but also over other officers
who perform functions related to accounting such as verification of evaluations and computation of fees
collectible, and the adoption of internal rules of control. (Mamaril vs. Domingo, 227 SCRA 206)
COA has only post-audit authority over:
- Constitutional bodies, commissions and offices that have been granted fiscal autonomy under this
## Constitution;
-  Autonomous state colleges and universities;
- Other government-owned or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries; and
- Such non-governmental entities receiving subsidy or equity, directly or indirectly, from or through the
Government, which are required by law or the granting institution to submit to such audit as a condition
of subsidy or equity.


## Judicial Review
a. Quasi-Judicial Functions
Section 1, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court provides:
SECTION 1. Scope. - This Rule shall apply to appeals from awards, judgments, final orders or
resolutions  of  or  authorized  by  any  quasi-judicial  agency  in  the  exercise  of  its  quasi-judicial
functions. Among these agencies are the Civil Service Commission, x x x.
The remedy of an aggrieved party from a resolution issued by the CSC is to file a petition for
review  thereof  under  Rule 43 of  the  Rules  of  Court  within  fifteen  days  from  notice  of  the  resolution.
Recourse to a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 renders the petition dismissible for being the wrong
remedy.  Nonetheless,  there  are  exceptions  to  this  rule,  to  wit:  (a)  when  public  welfare  and  the
advancement of public policy dictates; (b) when the broader interest of justice so requires; (c) when the
writs issued are null and void; or (d) when the
b. Administrative
The Comelec, under Art. IX (B), Sec. 2 (1) and (3), has the power to decide all administrative
cases  before  proclamation  or  “pre-proclamation  proceeding.  The  only  questions  that  may  not  be
touched by the Comelec are “those involving the right to vote.” Comelec has the authority to decide
whether a person has the constitutional qualifications needed to be voted for even on the national level.
After  proclamation,  the  neat  rule  should  be  that  the  Tribunal  and  the  courts  should  have
jurisdiction.
The  power  of  the  Comelec  to  examine  the  validity  of  proclamations  and  to  nullify  or  approve
them according to its findings ha been recognized. The broad discretion of the Comelec is subject to a

review power of the Supreme Court which has been narrowed within the limits of review by certiorari
under Rule 65.
