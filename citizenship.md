## CITIZENSHIP




Natural-born citizens
1) those who are citizens of the Philippines from birth without having to
perform any act to acquire or perfect their Philippine citizenship; and

Through    its    history,    four    modes    of    acquiring    citizenship -
naturalization, jus   soli, res   judicata and jus   sanguinis– had   been   in
vogue.  Only  two, i.e., jus  soli and jus  sanguinis,  could  qualify  a  person  to
being  a “natural-born” citizen  of  the  Philippines.  Jus  soli,  per Roa  vs.
Collector  of  Customs (1912),  did  not  last  long.  With  the  adoption  of  the
1935 Constitution and the reversal of Roa in Tan Chong vs. Secretary of
Labor (1947), jus  sanguinis or  blood  relationship  would  now  become  the
primary basis of citizenship by birth. (Tecson v. Comelec, 03 March 2004)

2)  those  who  born  before  January  17,  1973  who  elect  Philippine
citizenship upon reaching the age of majority.  (Section 2, Article IV)

Election of Citizenship: When must be made

Election should be made within a "reasonable time" after attaining the
age of majority.
The phrase “reasonable time" has been interpreted to mean that the
election  should  be  made  within  three  (3)  years  from  reaching  the  age  of
majority. However, we held in Cuenco vs. Secretary of Justice, that the three
(3) year period is not an inflexible rule.
In  the  present  case, Ching,  having  been  born  on  11 April  1964,  was
already thirty-five (35) years old when he complied with the requirements of
C.A.  No.  625  on  15  June  1999,  or  over  fourteen  (14)  years  after  he  had
reached the age of majority.  Based on the interpretation of the phrase “upon
reaching the age of majority," Ching's election was clearly beyond, by any
reasonable  yardstick,  the  allowable  period  within which  to  exercise  the
privilege. (Re: Vicente Ching 01 October 1999)

## Public Office

## NATURAL-BORN CITIZENS AND PUBLIC OFFICE



The  value  of  the  status  of  being  a  natural-born  citizen  could  be
appreciated   when   seen   in   relation   to   the   constitutionally   mandated
requirements for certain offices in the government that are reserved for such
individuals, such as that of the
- Presidency and
## 2. VP,
- membership in Congress,
- membership in the SC
- membership in other lower collegiate court,
- membership in Consti Comms Ombudsman and his Deputies
- Governing Board of the Central Monetary Authority
- Governing Board of the CHR (all of these positions requires a natural-
born citizens; see your codal).

## Also:
It  is  also  a  requirement  for  a  former  Filipino  who  desires  to  acquire
private  lands  that  he  was  previously  a  NB  citizen  Art  XII,  Sec  8. RA  9225
(Citizenship  Retention  and  Re-Acquisition  Act  of  2003)  vests  its  beneficial
effects on NB citizens.

2) Naturalization and Denaturalization

NATURALIZATION – Read Codal provisions of CA 473 and RA 9139

Naturalization signifies the act of formally adopting a foreigner into the
political  body  of  a  nation  by  clothing  him  or  her  with  the  privileges  of  a
citizen.  Under current and existing laws, there are three ways by which an
alien may become a citizen by naturalization:
(a) administrative naturalization pursuant to R.A. No. 9139;
(b) judicial naturalization pursuant to C.A. No. 473, as amended; and
(c) legislative naturalization in the form of a law enacted by Congress
bestowing Philippine citizenship to an alien. (So v. Republic, GR 170603)

Judicial Naturalization under CA 473 vs. Administrative Naturalization
under RA 9139

C.A. No. 473 and R.A. No. 9139 are separate and distinct laws – the
former  covers  all  aliens  regardless  of  class  while  the  latter  covers  native-
born aliens who lived here in the Philippines all their lives, who never saw
any other country and all along thought that they were Filipinos; who have

demonstrated love and loyalty to the Philippines and affinity to the customs
and traditions.

To reiterate, the intention of the legislature in enacting R.A. No. 9139
was to make the process of acquiring Philippine citizenship less tedious, less
technical and more encouraging which is administrative rather than judicial
in  nature.  Thus,  although  the  legislature  believes  that  there  is  a  need  to
liberalize the naturalization law of the Philippines, there is nothing from which
it can be inferred that C.A. No. 473 was intended to be amended or repealed
by  R.A.  No.  9139.  What  the  legislature  had  in  mind  was  merely  to
prescribe another mode  of  acquiring  Philippine  citizenship  which  may  be
availed of by native born aliens.  The only implication is that, a native born
alien  has  the  choice  to  apply  for  judicial  or  administrative  naturalization,
subject   to   the   prescribed   qualifications   and   disqualifications. (So   v.
## Republic, 29 January 2007)


Judicial  naturalization  under  CA 473  benefits  the  wife  and  minor
children

Any woman who is now or may hereafter be married to a citizen of the
Philippines, and who might herself be lawfully naturalized shall be deemed
a citizen of the Philippines. Minor children of persons naturalized under this
law  who  have  been  born  in  the  Philippines  shall  be  considered  citizens
thereof.

A foreign-born minor child, if dwelling in the Philippines at the time of
the  naturalization  of  the  parent,  shall  automatically  become  a  Philippine
citizen,  and  a foreign-born minor child,  who  is  not  in  the Philippines  at the
time  the  parent  is  naturalized,  shall  be  deemed  a  Philippine  citizen  only
during his minority, unless he begins to reside permanently in the Philippines
when still a minor, in which case, he will continue to be a Philippine citizen
even after becoming of age. (Section 15, CA 473)

The wife becomes a naturalized citizen if she does not have any of the
disqualifications for naturalization, by filing a petition for cancellation of her
alien certificate of registration, wherein she will show that she does not labor
under  any  of  the  disqualifications  for  naturalization.  After  her  ACR  is
cancelled,  she  may  take  her  oath  of  allegiance  to  the  Republic  of  the

Philippines. (Moy Ya Lim Yao v. Commissioner of Immigration, 41, SCRA
## 292)

Administrative  naturalization  under  RA  9139  benefits  the  wife  and
minor children

After the approval of the petition for administrative naturalization and
cancellation of applicant’s alien certificate of registration, applicant’s alien
lawful wife and minor children may file a petition for cancellation of their alien
certificates  of  registrations  with  the  Special  Committee  on  Naturalization
subject  to  the  payment  of  the  filing  fee  and  naturalization  fee,  then  upon
cancellation of the ACR, take the oath of allegiance to the Republic of the
Philippines. (Section 11, RA 9139)
If  the  applicant  is  a  married  woman,  the  approval  of  her  petition  for
administrative naturalization will not benefit her alien husband but her minor
children  may  file  a  petition  for  cancellation  for  their  alien  certificate  of
registration  with  the  BI  subject  to  the  requirements  of  existing  of  laws.
(Section 12, RA 9139)

Take    Note: Under    judicial    or    administrative    naturalization,    the
naturalization of a married woman will not benefit the alien husband.

Modes of Naturalization:

A. Direct: Citizenship is acquired by:
1) individual, through judicial or administrative proceedings,
2) special act of legislature,
3) collective change of nationality,
4) in some case, by adoption of orphan minors as nationals of the State
where they are born

B. Citizenship conferred on ,
1 ) Wife of naturalized husband,
2) Minor children of naturalized person,
3) alien woman upon marriage to a national (Nachura p. 238)

Doctrine of indelible allegiance – An individual may be compelled to retain
his original nationality even if he has already renounced or forfeited it under
the laws of the second State whose nationality he has acquired (Nachura p
## 238)

## DENATURALIZATION

CA    473; grounds    for    cancellation    of    the    certificate    of
naturalization
- If the naturalization certificate was obtained fraudulently or illegally
- If the person naturalized shall, within 5 years following the issuance of
the  certificate,  return  to  his  native  country    or  to  some  other  foreign
country and establish his permanent residence there
- If the petition was made on an invalid declaration of intention
- If it is shown that the minor children of the person naturalized failed to
graduate  from  a  public  or private  HS  recognized  by  the  government
through the fault of their parents.
- If the naturalized citizen has allowed himself to be used as a dummy
in violation of constitutional or legal provisions.

RA   9139;   grounds   for   cancellation   of   the   certificate   of
naturalization
- It   is   found   that   the   naturalized   person   or   his   duly   authorized
representative  made  any  false  statement  or  misrepresentation  or
committed any violation of law, rules and regulations in connection with
the   petition   for   naturalization,   or   otherwise   obtained   Philippine
citizenship fraudulently or illegally

- The  naturalized  person  or  his  wife,  or  any  of  his  minor  children  who
acquired  Filipino  citizenship  by  virtue  of  his  naturalization,  within  5
years   following   the   grant   of   Philippine   citizenship,   established
permanent residence in a foreign country.

- The  naturalized  person  or  his  wife  or  child  with  acquired  citizenship
allowed himself or herself to be used as a dummy.

- The  naturalized  person  or  his  wife  or  child  with  acquired  citizenship
committed any act inimical to national security.

Insofar  as  denaturalization  proceedings  are  concerned,  the  rules  of
construction    become    reversed.    Unlike,    therefore,    in    naturalization
proceedings where the facts and the law may be interpreted and construed
strictly against the applicant, in a denaturalization case, the reverse is true.

3) Loss of Citizenship

Under  Commonwealth  Act  No.  63,  a  Filipino  citizen  may  lose  his
citizenship:

(1) By naturalization in a foreign country;
(2) By express renunciation of citizenship;
(3) By subscribing to an oath of allegiance to support the constitution or laws
of a foreign country upon attaining twenty-one years of age or more;
(4)  By  accepting  commission  in  the  military,  naval  or  air  service  of  a
foreign country;
(5) By cancellation of the certificate of naturalization;
(6)  By  having  been  declared  by  competent  authority,  a  deserter  of  the
Philippine  armed  forces  in  time  of  war,  unless  subsequently,  a  plenary
pardon or amnesty has been granted: and
(7) In case of a woman, upon her marriage, to a foreigner if, by virtue of the
laws in force in her husband’s country, she acquires his nationality. Valles v.
## Comelec, 9 August 2000

Take Note: No. [1] has already been modified by Republic Act 9225, under
which Filipino citizens who become naturalized citizens of a foreign country
may retain their Filipino citizenship by complying with the provisions of RA
## 9225.

Take Note: No. [7]  has been repealed  by  the  1987 Constitution. It  is  no
longer  a  ground  for  loss  of  citizenship  under  the  1987  Constitution,  which
provides  that  citizens  of  the  Philippines  who  marry  aliens  shall  retain  their
citizenship, unless by their act or omission they are deemed, under the law,
to have renounced it. (Section 4, Article IV, 1987 Constitution)



Loss of Citizenship by Express Renunciation

In order that citizenship may be lost by renunciation, such renunciation
must  be  express.  An  application  for  an  alien  certificate  of  registration  and
mere  holding  of  a  foreign  passport  are  not  acts  constituting  an  effective
renunciation of citizenship. See Valles vs. Comelec 337 SCRA 543

Take  Note: Merely  having  a  foreign  passport  and  an  alien  certificate  of
registration is not effective renunciation: renunciation must be express


The mere fact that private respondent Rosalind Ybasco Lopez was a
holder of an Australian passport and had an alien certificate of registration
are not acts constituting an effective renunciation of citizenship and do not
militate   against   her   claim   of   Filipino   citizenship.  For   renunciation   to
effectively  result  in  the  loss  of  citizenship,  the  same  must  be  express.  An
application  for  an  alien  certificate  of  registration  and  holding  of  a  foreign
passport do not amount to an express renunciation or repudiation of one’s
citizenship. (Valles vs. Comelec, 337 SCRA 543)

## 4)  Repatriation

Read Codal Provisions of Republic Act 9225, Republic Act 8171, and
## Commonwealth Act 63

Repatriation is not a matter of right, but it is a privilege granted by the
State. This is mandated by the 1987 Constitution under Section 3, Article IV,
which  provides  that  citizenship  may  be  lost  or  reacquired  in  the  manner
provided  by  law.  The  State  has  the  power  to  prescribe  by  law  the
qualifications, procedure, and requirements for repatriation. It has the power
to  determine  if  an  applicant  for  repatriation  meets  the  requirements  of  the
law for it is an inherent power of the State to choose who will be its citizens,
and  who  can  reacquire  citizenship  once  it  is  lost. (Tabasa    v.  Court  of
## Appeals, 29 August 2006)



Effect of repatriation

Repatriation  results  in  the recovery  of  the  original  nationality. This
means that a naturalized Filipino who lost his citizenship will be restored to
his prior status as a naturalized Filipino citizen.  On the other hand, if he was
originally a natural-born citizen before he lost his Philippine citizenship, he
will be restored to his former status as a natural-born Filipino. (Bengson v.
HRET,  07 May 2001)

Take Note: Repatriation does not result in the recovery of original/former
Philippine domicile

Ty’s reacquisition of his Philippine citizenship under Republic Act No.
9225 had no automatic impact or effect on his residence/domicile.  He could

still  retain  his  domicile  in  the USA,  and  he  did  not  necessarily  regain his
domicile    in    the Municipality of General    Macarthur,    Eastern    Samar,
Philippines.  Ty  merely  had  the  option  to  again  establish  his  domicile  in
the Municipality of General  Macarthur,  Eastern  Samar,  Philippines,  said
place  becoming  his  new  domicile  of  choice.  The  length  of  his  residence
therein shall be determined from the time he made it his domicile of choice,
and  it  shall  not  retroact  to  the  time  of  his  birth.   (Japzon  v.  Comelec,  19
## January 2009)

## Applicable Repatriation Laws

1) Republic  Act 9225, “Citizenship Retention and Reacquisition
Act”. Available to natural-born citizens of the Philippines who have lost their
Philippine citizenship by reason of their naturalization as citizens of a foreign
country

2) Republic Act 8171, “An Act Providing  for  the  Repatriation  of
Filipino   Women   Who   Have   Lost   Their   Philippine   Citizenship   by
Marriage  to  Aliens and  of  Natural-Born  Filipinos”. Available  to  Filipino
women   who   have   lost   their   Philippine   citizenship   by   marriage   to
aliens and natural-born  Filipinos  who  have  lost  their  Philippine  citizenship,
including their minor children, on account of political or economic necessity.

3)  Commonwealth  Act  63. Available  to  persons  declared  by  competent
authority to be a deserter of the Philippine army, navy or air corps in time of
war, unless subsequently granted a plenary pardon or amnesty.

## Repatriation Laws
Citizenship Retention and Reacquisition under Republic Act 9225

Who  may  reacquire  Philippine  citizenship: Natural-born  citizens  of  the
Philippines  who  have  lost  their  Philippine  citizenship  by  reason  of  their
naturalization as citizens of a foreign country (Section 3, RA 9225)

How  citizenship  is  reacquired:  By  taking  the  oath  of  allegiance: They
are  deemed  to  have  reacquired  Philippine  citizenship  upon  taking the
following oath of allegiance to the Republic:


Who may retain their Philippine citizenship: Natural-born citizens of the
Philippines who, after the effectivity of RA 9225, become citizens of a foreign
country

How  citizenship  is  retained:  Taking  of  oath  of  allegiance: They  shall
retain their Philippine citizenship upon taking the aforesaid oath of allegiance
to the Republic.

Derivative citizenship for minor children under RA 9225: The unmarried
child, whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted, below eighteen (18) years
of age, of those who reacquire Philippine citizenship upon effectivity of RA
9225 shall be deemed citizens of the Philippines. (Section 4)

Full civil and political rights of those who reacquire citizenship under
RA 9225: Those who retain or reacquire Philippine citizenship under this Act
shall enjoy full civil and political rights and be subject to all attendant liabilities
and responsibilities under existing laws of the Philippines and the following
conditions:
(1)  Those  intending  to  exercise  their  right  of  suffrage  must  meet  the
requirements under Section 1, Article V of the Constitution, Republic Act No.
9189, otherwise known as “The Overseas Absentee Voting Act of 2003” and
other existing laws;
(2)  Those  seeking  elective  public  office  in  the  Philippines  shall  meet
the qualifications for holding such public office as required by the Constitution
and existing laws and, at the time of the filing of the certificate of candidacy,
make  a  personal  and sworn  renunciation  of  any  and  all foreign  citizenship
before any public officer authorized to administer an oath;
(3) Those appointed to any public office shall subscribe and swear to
an  oath  of  allegiance  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  and  its  duly
constituted authorities prior to their assumption of office: Provided, That they
renounce their oath of allegiance to the country where they took that oath;(4)
Those intending to practice their profession in the Philippines shall apply with
the  proper  authority  for  a  license  or  permit  to  engage  in  such  practice.
(Section 5, RA 9225)

Those who reacquire citizenship under RA 9225 but cannot vote or be
elected  or  appointed  to  public  office: The  right  to  vote  or  be  elected  or
appointed to any public office in the Philippines cannot be exercised by, or
extended to, those who:

(a) are candidates for or are occupying any public office in the country
of which they are naturalized citizens; and/or
(b)  are  in  the  active  service as  commissioned  or  noncommissioned
officers in the armed forces of the country which they are naturalized citizens.
(Section 5, RA 9225)

Additional  Requirement  to  Run  for  Public  Office  for  Those  who
Reacquire Citizenship under RA 9225
Breaking down the afore-quoted provision, for a natural born Filipino,
who reacquired or retained his Philippine citizenship under Republic Act No.
9225, to run for public office, he must:
(1) meet the qualifications for holding such public office as required by
the Constitution and existing laws; and
(2)  make  a  personal  and  sworn  renunciation  of  any  and  all  foreign
citizenships   before   any   public   officer   authorized   to   administer   an
oath. (Japzon v. Comelec, 19 January 2009)
A candidate’s oath of allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines and
his Certificate of Candidacy do not substantially comply with the requirement
of  a  personal  and  sworn  renunciation  of  foreign  citizenship.  The  law
categorically  requires  persons  seeking  elective  public  office,  who  either
retained  their  Philippine  citizenship  or  those  who  reacquired  it,  to  make  a
personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenship before a
public officer authorized to administer an oath simultaneous with or before
the filing of the certificate of candidacy.

Hence, Section  5(2)  of  Republic  Act  No.  9225 compels natural-born
Filipinos, who have been naturalized as citizens of a foreign country, but who
reacquired or retained their Philippine citizenship
(1) to take the oath of allegiance under Section 3 of Republic Act No.
9225, and
(2)  for  those  seeking  elective  public  offices  in  the  Philippines,  to
additionally execute a personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign
citizenship  before  an  authorized  public  officer  prior  or  simultaneous  to  the
filing of their certificates of candidacy,to qualify as candidates in Philippine
elections.  (Jacot v. Dal, G.R. No. 179848)

RA 9225 allows dual citizenship, not dual allegiance
The intent of the legislature in drafting Rep. Act No. 9225 is to do away
with the provision in Commonwealth Act No. 63 which takes away Philippine

citizenship  from  natural-born  Filipinos  who  become  naturalized  citizens  of
other countries.

What Rep. Act No. 9225 does is allow dual citizenship to natural-born
Filipino  citizens  who  have  lost  Philippine  citizenship  by  reason  of  their
naturalization  as  citizens  of  a  foreign  country.  On  its  face,  it  does  not
recognize  dual  allegiance.  By  swearing  to  the  supreme  authority  of  the
Republic,  the  person  implicitly  renounces  his  foreign  citizenship.  Plainly,
from Section 3, Rep. Act No. 9225 stayed clear out of the problem of dual
allegiance and shifted the burden of confronting the issue of whether or not
there is dual allegiance to the concerned foreign country.  What happens to
the other citizenship was not made a concern of Rep. Act No. 9225. AASJS
v. Datumanong, 11 May 2007

Dual citizens may vote in Philippine elections without actually residing
and physically staying in the Philippines

There  is  no  provision  in  the  dual  citizenship  law - R.A.  9225 -
requiring "duals" to  actually  establish  residence  and  physically  stay  in  the
Philippines first before they can exercise their right to vote.  On the contrary,
R.A.  9225,  in  implicit  acknowledgment  that  “duals”  are  most  likely  non-
residents,  grants  under  its  Section  5(1)  the  same  right  of  suffrage  as that
granted an absentee voter under R.A. 9189. It cannot be overemphasized
that  R.A.  9189  aims,  in  essence,  to  enfranchise  as  much  as  possible  all
overseas Filipinos who, save for the residency requirements exacted of an
ordinary voter under ordinary conditions, are qualified to vote. Nicolas-Lewis
v. Comelec, 04 August 2006

"Duals"  may  now  exercise  the  right  of  suffrage  thru  the absentee
voting scheme   and   as overseas   absentee   voters. (Nicolas-Lewis   v.
## Comelec, 04 August 2006)


Reacquisition  of  citizenship  under  RA  9225  does  not  automatically
mean regaining residence/domicile in the Philippines

Ty’s reacquisition of his Philippine citizenship under Republic Act No.
9225 had no automatic impact or effect on his residence/domicile.  He could
still  retain  his  domicile  in  the USA,  and  he  did  not  necessarily  regain  his
domicile    in    the Municipality of General    Macarthur,    Eastern    Samar,

Philippines.  Ty  merely  had  the  option  to  again  establish  his  domicile  in
the Municipality of General Macarthur,  Eastern  Samar,  Philippines,  said
place  becoming  his  new  domicile  of  choice.  The  length  of  his  residence
therein shall be determined from the time he made it his domicile of choice,
and  it  shall  not  retroact  to  the  time  of  his  birth.   (Japzon  v.  Comelec,  19
## January 2009)

Repatriation under Republic Act 8171

Persons qualified for repatriation under RA 8171:
The  only  persons  entitled  to  repatriation  under  RA  8171  are  the
following:
a.  Filipino women who lost their Philippine citizenship by marriage to
aliens; and
b.  Natural-born  Filipinos including their  minor children who  lost their
Philippine citizenship on account of political or economic necessity.

The privilege of repatriation under RA 8171 is available only to natural-
born Filipinos who lost their citizenship on account of political or economic
necessity, and to the minor children of said natural-born Filipinos.
This  means  that  if  a  parent  who  had  renounced  his  Philippine
citizenship  due  to  political  or  economic  reasons  later  decides  to  repatriate
under RA 8171, his repatriation will also benefit his minor children according
to  the  law.  This  includes  a  situation  where  a  former  Filipino  subsequently
had children while he was a naturalized citizen of a foreign country.
The repatriation  of  the  former  Filipino  will  allow  him  to  recover  his
natural-born citizenship and automatically vest Philippine citizenship on his
children  of jus  sanguinis or  blood  relationship  the  children  acquire  the
citizenship of their parent(s) who are natural-born Filipinos.
To  claim  the  benefit  of  RA  8171,  however,  the  children  must  be  of
minor age at the time the petition for repatriation is filed by the parent.  This
is so because a child does not have the legal capacity for all acts of civil life
much  less  the  capacity  to  undertake  a  political  act  like  the  election  of
citizenship.  On their own, the minor children cannot apply for repatriation or
naturalization separately from their parents. (Tabasa v. Court of Appeals,
## 29 August 2006)


Where  to file  a  petition  for  repatriation  pursuant  to  RA  8171: The
applicant must file his petition for repatriation with the Special Committee on

Naturalization   (SCN),   which   was   designated   to   process   petitions   for
repatriation  pursuant  to  Administrative  Order  No. 285 (A.O.  No.  285)
dated August 22, 1996. The Special Committee on

Naturalization  shall  be  composed  of  with  the  Solicitor  General  as
Chairman, the Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs and the Director-General of
the   National   Intelligence   Coordinating   Agency,   as   members.   If   the
applications is  approved,  he  or  she  shall  take  the  necessary  oath  of
allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines, after which she or she shall be
deemed  to  have  reacquired  Philippine  citizenship.    (Tabasa    v. Court of
## Appeals)

The principle of res judicata generally does not apply in cases hinging
on  the  issue  of  citizenship. However,  as  an  exception, the  doctrine  of res
judicata may be applied in cases of citizenship, when the following requisites
are present:
1) a person’s citizenship be raised as a material issue in a controversy
where said person is a party;
2)  the  Solicitor  General  or  his  authorized  representative  took  active
part in the resolution thereof, and
3) the finding on citizenship is affirmed by the Supreme Court.  (Valles
v. Comelec)
